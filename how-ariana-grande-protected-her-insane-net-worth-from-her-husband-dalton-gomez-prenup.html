Unsurprisingly, a lot of the opportunities that most celebrities get to enjoy come along with something else, massive paycheques. After all, there is a reason why most people associate the words fame and fortune with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike business leaders who amass impressive fortunes, most celebrities who become wealthy have an artistic background. Due to their backgrounds not preparing them to properly protect their finances, far too many <a href=#>once-wealthy stars have gone broke</a> over the years.</p><p>Of course, there are a lot of different ways for stars to lose a lot of their cash. For example, even though they were able to recover financially, Kevin Bacon And Kyra Sedgwick once were swindled out of a huge chunk of the money they made during their careers. Fortunately for <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>, she doesn’t have to worry about losing a lot of money to her husband if things ever go awry since she is protected against that potential problem.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Who Swindled Kevin Bacon And Kyra Sedgwick Out Of A Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-romantic-life>Her Romantic Life</h2><p>Since she has spent the majority of her life in the spotlight, the tabloids have been there to report on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande’s romantic relationships</a> often in less than kind terms. In reality, no matter how much some of Grande’s relationships have been judged by the press, nobody but the people involved can truly know what went on between Ariana and her exes. However, based on the lyrics of Grande’s hit song “Thank U, Next” it seems clear that she has taken something out of all of her past relationships which is fantastic if true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as the press knows, Ariana Grande’s first notable relationship was with The Good Wife star Graham Phillips. After Grande and Phillips met when they were both starring in Broadway’s “13: The Musical”, the pair went on to date from 2008 until 2011. On the bright side, Grande and Graham clearly didn’t have an overly nasty breakup since they came together again in 2016 for a “13: The Musical” reunion.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Are Ariana Grande’s Exes? Here's What We Know</a></span></p><p>After Ariana Grande’s first publically acknowledged relationship came to an end, she would go on to get involved with several other notable people. For example, it is known that Grande once was linked to Jai Brooks, Nathan Sykes, Big Sean, Ricky Alvarez, and Mikey Foster. While all of those relationships all but certainly were meaningful for Grande, two of her other romances got a lot more coverage in the press.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once they met when they collaborated on a song titled “The Way”, Ariana Grande and Mac Miller dated from 2016 until 2018. After their split, Grande and Miller both made it abundantly clear that their relationship was extremely meaningful for them. Sadly, Miller would go on to meet his untimely demise mere months after he and Grande broke up. In response to her ex’s passing, Grande posted a truly touching tribute to him on Instagram.</p><p>After Ariana Grande and Mac Miller split up, the world was shocked to learn that she had gotten involved with Pete Davidson. Even though their relationship didn’t last long and many people felt that Davidson wasn’t “good enough” for Grande, it seems like they were very happy while things lasted. After all, Davidson once spoke about feeling like he “won a contest” he was so elated to be dating Grande and they were briefly engaged before their breakup was announced.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Did Ariana Grande Do With Her Engagement Ring From Pete Davidson?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=protecting-herself>Protecting Herself</h2><p>Considering that it is perfectly normal for people to get involved in relationships that go awry, it is a shame that certain members of the media have felt the need to judge Grande’s romantic history. After all, it can be very hard to know what you want in a partner if you don’t have the experience to identify what you don’t want. On top of that, the fact that Grande has been involved in some failed relationships is likely why she has been wise enough to protect her fortune.</p><p>Over the years, <a href=#>some celebrity divorces have involved so much money</a> that it is staggering to even consider splitting that much cash. Considering that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande is worth $180 million</a> as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com, she could have had an awful lot to lose if she was unprotected going into the wrong marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ariana Grande’s legions of fans learned that she’d tied the knot with her real estate agent significant other in May 2021, some of them were concerned that he may be after her money. Fortunately, it certainly seems like his intentions are pure since according to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grande’s husband Dalton Gomez signed a prenup</a>. In fact, if the reports are true, Grande’s lawyers spent months putting together an “iron-clad pre-nuptial agreement which Gomez and Ariana signed before they walked down the aisle.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>See What Ariana Grande Has Posted For Her Husband, Dalton Gomez's 26th Birthday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dlr%2Bqrc2aZKCqkaOxpnnPq6atnZOpsqV5x56pZqGeqK6vsYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMn6mopV2dsrN5x66qm5memXqlrcutpqdll6S6psaMqamepqWlfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jay-pharoah-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay Pharoah Parents, Net Worth, Height, Ethnicity, Age, Wiki">&larr;
