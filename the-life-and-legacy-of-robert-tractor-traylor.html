He left a significant legacy in both his personal and professional lives. This article highlights Traylor's life and untimely death, along with his legacy that lives on many years later.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Background and Basketball Career</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Robert Traylor was born on February 1, 1977, in Detroit, Michigan. At Murray Wright High School, Taylor quickly proved his basketball prowess defensively in football. He stood 6-8 and weighed more than 300 pounds, a combination of size, strength, and agility that made you wonder what could have been if he had continued to develop in other ways.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Traylor played college basketball at Michigan after an illustrious high school career. In his time with the Wolverines, he displayed that dominance at forward and got some of those awards and recognition for what he brought to the team. His performance at DePaul earned him notice from NBA scouts, who selected the forward with the sixth overall pick of the 1998 Draft. He would, however, be soon put on the trading block by Milwaukee, and that is how he ended up starting his NBA career in a Bucks jersey.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A long NBA career followed, and Traylor played for teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers and Charlotte Hornets. He was a fiery, physical player during his career who earned the love and respect of teammates, coaches around the league, and fans alike.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Death Came Unexpectedly</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Robert "Tractor" Traylor died tragically at just 34 years old on May 11, 2011. His loss hit the basketball community like a ton of bricks and put everybody in mourning. He was found dead under tragic circumstances, and he left a void in the hearts of all who knew him or followed his career over the years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Traylor supposedly died from a heart attack, but that doesn't make his death any less premature. His death brought an instant wave of tributes and condolences from around the basketball world as friends, former teammates, and fans mourned his impact on the sport.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>How His Basketball Career Changed the Game</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Traylor's lasting impression goes beyond numbers or games won or played. He was a larger-than-life figure with an incredible smile and an unwavering commitment to the game that so many fell in love with. He influenced many young athletes and has had an enduring impact on the teams and communities with whom he was associated.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To this day, his impact is felt in the sport, and he is one of those remembered greats whom we continue to memorialize.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In Memory of Robert "Tractor" Traylor</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Robert "Tractor" Traylor's academic and athletic life testified to his passion for basketball, the effort required to compete at this level, and the love that endures. His passing was a sad reminder of life's fleeting nature and how some dwell in our lives briefly. Though his actual being may be gone, he remains in the souls that felt his kindness and presence.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The enduring memory of Traylor in basketball provides a good example of how sports can unite folks, motivate them, and make them feel better about themselves. His life is a poignant example of how one person can make an incredible difference in the world through his play and outside it.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His memory lives on, and his example remains a testament to what the human spirit is still capable of.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfqbWmecuinZ5lkaOxbrjEoJicsV2ks26%2Bzpucq6xdqb%2Bir9OoqWasopbGrbvR</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2022-34-atl-uanl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tigres UANL vs. Atlas Prediction by Proven Computer Model [2/18/2023]">&larr;
