Looking back on Toddlers & Tiaras' legacy, many people remember the show for its <a href=#>disturbing moments</a> and some fans think of <a href=#>the reboot they rejected</a>.Despite all of that, it still seems pretty clear that Toddlers & Tiaras is most remembered for introducing the world to a young girl who went by the nickname Honey Boo Boo. After debuting on Toddlers & Tiaras, Honey Boo Boo's entire family would go on to become famous too.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>7 Things On 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' That Were So Fake (And 8 Real)</a></span>Thanks to the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, it is clear that the show's starring family is colorful, to say the very least. A perfect example of that, Honey Boo Boo's father Sugar Bear Thompson is a very different man than most reality stars.After many years of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo fans watching Sugar Bear Thompson on television, many of them were worried to learn he was undergoing a serious health scare. Since then, the fate of Sugar Bear's battle against his ailment has been revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-happened-to-sugar-bear-thompson-s-personal-life>What Has Happened To Sugar Bear Thompson's Personal Life?</h2><p>When most fans think of Sugar Bear Thompson, it is the fact that he is Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson's father that comes to mind first and foremost. Of course, by definition, that means that Sugar Bear was involved with Mama June at one time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Honey Boo Boo Still Have A Relationship With Her Dad, Sugar Bear Thompson?</a></span></p><p>As Here Comes Honey Boo Boo fans will no doubt already know, Sugar Bear and Mama June became a couple in 2004. After Sugar Bear and Mama June were together for several years, she learned that he'd been unfaithful.</p><p>As a result of the cheating scandal, Sugar Bear and Mama June's relationship ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Sugar Bear was single again for the first time in many years, he went on to marry a woman who took the name Jennifer Thompson after their wedding. Unfortunately for Sugar Bear and Jennifer, it turned out that their relationship wasn't meant to last either.</p><p>In January 2022, Jennifer took to Facebook to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announce the end of her marriage to Sugar Bear</a>.</p><p>"Me and Mike went our different ways yes it's hard but we will work through it and we will remain friends. So now when everyone sees us and we are not together everyone will know what's going on. Just no questions please."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-caused-sugar-bear-thompson-s-dental-emergency>What Caused Sugar Bear Thompson's Dental Emergency?</h2><p>Many decades ago, some doctors actually believed that tobacco was good for people. Over the last several decades, however, that certainly has changed as virtually everyone now knows that tobacco is awful for people.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Mama June: From Hot To Not': What Is Sugar Bear's Job?</a></span></p><p>Fortunately, tobacco usage has significantly lessened over the last several years. However, even though it is wonderful that many people have quit using tobacco products, some of them will still suffer consequences from their past dependence.</p><p>After Sugar Bear Thompson regularly used chewing tobacco for more than a decade, he eventually put the habit behind him. Still, in May 2022, it seemed like Sugar Bear's past tobacco usage had caught up with him.</p><p>Following the end of his marriage to Jennifer, Sugar Bear wanted to look more attractive. As a result, Sugar Bear sought to get his teeth fixed in May 2022 and that led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his dentist finding something very troubling</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While examining Sugar Bear's mouth, his dentist discovered several white spots on the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star's gums. As doctors and dentists have figured out over the years, spots like those often are an indication of cancer.</p><p>While there is no such thing as a good kind of cancer, there certainly are forms of cancer that are worse than others. Tragically for anyone who contracts them, cancers of the throat and mouth are extremely difficult to battle.</p><p>Fortunately for Sugar Bear, it turns out that he isn't one of many <a href=#>celebrities who've beaten cancer</a>. The reason for that is while a tumor was removed from Sugar Bear's mouth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was benign</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Sugar Bear's benign tumor was removed, his dental makeover could proceed as previously planned. After Sugar Bear's teeth were removed, his dentist installed top and bottom snap-in dentures.</p><p>To say that Sugar Bear's new teeth transformed his face is an understatement. Sugar Bear also underwent other procedures including a hair transplant and injections to get wrinkles removed from his face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrp%2BRp3qjscCrZK2gn6K9tLvNZp%2BemZyptW6%2FwpqpnmWnnbKzsYyhnGaho2LBsLDAsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-caused-jimmy-deans-death-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What caused Jimmy Deans death?">&larr;
