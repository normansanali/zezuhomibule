The show follows a young Afro-Latina teen named Luz Noceda (voiced by Sarah-Nicole Robles(fun fact, Luz is named after one of Dana's friends and former roommate, who works on the show as well)) who is out of the norm from everyone else due to her interests in the fanatical and just falling out of normal interests altogether. On behest of her school, her mother plans to send her to a reality check summer camp to help her get her impulses in check but before Luz can leave she chases a owl like creature who stole a book from her and stumbles upon a portal to the Boiling Isles in the Demon Realm. There she meets Eda (voiced by Wendie Malick), the Owl Lady the most powerful Witch in said realm and the most wanted criminal as well, in exchange for bringing her home, Eda asks if Luz can do a favor for her and her friend King (voiced by <i>Gravity Falls</i> creator Alex Hirsch), an intelligent Beast Demon and self-proclaimed King of Demons. After helping them out, Luz asks she can stay with them for her the summer as Eda's witch apprentice despite the fact humans cannot learn magic by any known means instead of returning home and going to the summer camp; Eda agrees and thus Luz begins her adventures at the Boiling Isles and her stay at The Owl House, a living house demon named Hooty (also voiced by Hirsch) along side Eda and King.</p><p>The show breaks a lot of barriers for a Disney cartoon, especially more than its spiritual predecessor<i> Gravity Falls</i> with the fight against the Disney Censors. With having a gender non-conforming bisexual protagonist as well as an openly lesbian character and as of S2E7, a non-binary character. The show as been nominated for awards and has won a Peabody Award in 2021 for Children's & Youth Programming thanks to breaking said barriers.</p><p>As of right now at the time of writing this, the shows Second Season is currently airing with Episode 27 (Episode 8 of Season 2) of the series as whole; "Knock, Knock, Knockin' on Hooty's Door" was released as of this post. The show is scheduled to receive a third and last season however it will be three forty-four minute episodes instead of the usual around twenty 10-22 minute episodes like Dana Terrace and fans were expecting. Fans are currently campaigning to help get the show continued so that The Owl Crew can finish the story the way they want to with a fourth season as it is too late to extend Season 3. If you haven't watch the show and want to give it a shot or want to support the show's fanbase for a continued series, the first season is on Disney Plus and its second season is slowly getting added every five episodes of the show airs.</p><p><b><span>And now that's out of the way, this thread is open for discussion of the show, theories or anything regarding the show you wish to discuss with fellow fans. Spoilers in bound for those who haven't watch the show and for those who haven't caught up with the show.</span></b></p><p>Please remember to discuss with accordance with the standard Bulbagarden Forums rules and please remember to respect each others opinions. Otherwise, happy discussing and I hope to join you all in the fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1tMRmprCkXZ28tr%2FEZphmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjJympp2Urnq0sdGinKxlkq56pa3NmmStnaKnrqSxjWtvcG9laHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./unforgotten-sinead-keenan-family-connections-famous-siblings-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unforgotten: Sinad Keenan's family connections including famous siblings revealed">&larr;
