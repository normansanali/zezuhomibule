Like most others, this elaborate social experiment is also about contestants trying to outsmart each other. It brings together 12 savvy contestants to face off in mind-bending games of wit and strategy to decide who is the brainiest of them all. Kwedo AKA Orbit is one of these people. So, in the rest of the writing, we are going to tell you all about him.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Kwedo AKA Orbit On Netflix’s The Devil’s Plan</strong></h3><p>Kwedo AKA Orbit may or may not have won this show called&nbsp;The Devil’s Plan, but he is already a favorite among fans. Soon after the episodes were out, viewers were quick to tweet their opinions about Kwedo. “Orbit is actually so smart and good in his second main game like he can forsee their rival team’s next move or plans during the game…” one of these fanatics gushed. Another new fan girl of Kwedo wrote “Watching the devil’s plan … I need orbit so badly”.</p><p>Kwedo must be not surprised because he gave it all after he was confirmed to be on the project. When he first got the call he said he was interested in science but not in other aspects of the show like competition and survival. It was after knowing that it was being released in 170 countries with dubbing and subtitles, he thought it might be too good an opportunity. So, this is how it turned out in Kwedo’s words. He had to talk about science for 16 hours a day, excluding sleeping and playing games. He also cried a lot because of the special family-like bond he formed with all eleven of them on the show. There, he said, made memories that he could not experience anywhere else. Also, he also requested watchers to understand that as part of the game, he made a fool of himself many a time by being excited, betraying his good friends, and crying a lot in an ugly way.</p><p>In addition to Kwedo, celebrities, lawyers, doctors, professional Go players, and more, were invited to the game to compete to win the ultimate prize of 500 million won (approximately $392,700). The concept here is such that the contestants were kept in a week-long camp. Then, their limits were tested through fierce mind-bending games to find the final winner. Among them, one was to be crowned as the brainiest player.</p><p>The cast included Ha Seok Jin, Cho Yeon Woo, Lee Si Won, Seo Dong Joo, <a href=#>Lee Hye-seong</a>, Park Kyung Lim, Guillaume Patry, Kwak Joon Bin, and two non-celebrities: Seo Yoo Min and Kim Dong Jae.</p><p>About Kwedo particularly, it was said that he will demonstrate a high understanding of any game with his scientific thinking and analysis and will prove that “games are also science.”</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Kwedo AKA Orbit Job</strong></h3><p>Kwedo AKA Orbit is a science communicator and YouTuber who studied astronomy.
