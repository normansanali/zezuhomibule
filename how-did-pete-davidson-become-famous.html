But how exactly did he become such a force in Hollywood, who has taken the media by storm with his new romance with Kim Kardashian?

He saved my life. I would’ve killed myself if I didn’t have Kid Cudi,” he said.</p><p>“I would’ve killed myself. Absolutely, 100 percent. If you’re 25 and under, I believe Kid Cudi saved your life. I truly believe if ‘Man on the Moon’ didn’t come out, I wouldn’t be here.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Kid Cudi had just checked himself into rehab at the time to tackle his depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Astroworld Victim's Family Brand Kanye West 'Idiotic' After He Demands Billie Eilish Apologize To Travis Scott</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking on the rapper’s struggles, Davidson shared: “It’s kind of comforting to know your hero goes through the same stuff you do.
