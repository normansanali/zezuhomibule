After an awkward question about Wiig's nude scene, his guests were confused before telling the reporter he was discussing another film. Parente admitted he hadn't watched their film, and got called out for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bill-hader-and-kristen-wiig-called-out-a-reporter-for-not-seeing-their-film>Bill Hader And Kristen Wiig Called Out A Reporter For Not Seeing Their Film</h2><p>During an interview with Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, reporter Chris Parente made an epic mistake when he awkwardly asked the Bridesmaids actor about her "full-frontal nudity" in the film. After some initial confusion, the two SNL stars realized he hadn't seen their film, and laughing, called out Parente for not watching their movie.</p><p>Although some stars might get angry, Wiig and Hader gave Parente a hard time. Hader joked he was "nude in this movie, and [he was] upside down the whole time." The Trainwreck actor playfully scolded Parente. "Chris, did you see this film? Chris!" Wiig also informed their interviewer her nude scene took place in a different film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gesturing towards the promotional movie poster behind them, Hader looked like he might start giggling again as he reminded Parente, "It's The Skeleton Twins, which is a drama that played at Sundance, and it has us in it, and it's a totally different movie." The Barry actor also attempted to clear things up for viewers.</p><p>"Everybody in Denver right now is going, 'Which movie do we go see?' The movie you want to go see is called The Skeleton Twins. Kristen is fully clothed in it, I'm fully clothed in it." Wiig, chuckling, added, "And Chris has not seen it," causing Hader to burst out laughing.</p><h2 id=reporter-chris-parente-made-awkward-comments-about-nudity-that-weren-39-t-in-wiig-and-hader-39-s-film>Reporter Chris Parente Made Awkward Comments About Nudity That Weren't In Wiig And Hader's Film</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kristen-Wiig.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Denver reporter Chris Parente was interviewing Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as they promoted The Skeleton Twins, Parente decided to make a joke about Wiig's (nonexistent) nude scene, only for his comment to blow up in his face. Early on, Parente said, "Kristen, I am thinking on this program of doing the news completely full-frontal, completely nude. Do you recommend that? Do you have any advice for going nude?"</p><p>The interviewer's awkward comments were met with a mixture of shock, surprise and silence from the stars, as they tried to figure out what his suddenly odd question meant. "Advice for going nude..." Wiig responded. Unfortunately, no one was able to tell him about the huge mistake he'd just made, and Parente kept going, insisting, "You do it in the film!"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:01</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kristen-wiig-s-changing-face-has-fans-questioning-her-past-statements-on-plastic-surgery-front-deposit-back-golden-globes_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kristen Wiig's Changing Face Has Fans Questioning Her Past Statements On Plastic Surgery</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Following her time with Will Ferrell at the Golden Globes, fans couldn't help but notice Kristen Wiig's "new look."</span><p>Erupting into laughter at the reporter's monumental mistake, Wiig and Hader corrected the reporter, telling him, "Not in this film. Not in this movie." Wiig added, "That's a different movie," referring to another of her films, Welcome to Me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Parente made such awkward comments in front of the talented comedians, they couldn't help but heckle him throughout the rest of the interview. "This was great," Wiig added, as the two called out the reporter for his huge mistake. "Chris this is live," reminded Hader, laughing.</p><h2 id=embarrassed-parente-promised-to-see-the-movie-while-wiig-and-hader-couldn-39-t-stop-laughing>Embarrassed, Parente Promised To See The Movie, While Wiig And Hader Couldn't Stop Laughing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar47273647.jpg><p>Surprisingly, some stars have managed not to walk out of some incredibly uncomfortable interviews, but can react differently. Some might get annoyed. <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson once lost it on a reporter for confusing him with Laurence Fishburne</a>. Some stars are taken aback by awkward questions, but try to steer the interview in a different direction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He insisted the scene was featured in the film, but Wiig and Hader quickly pointed out he was talking about another one of Wiig's films: Welcome to Me.</p><p>Before the interview, reporter Chris Parente showed a brief clip of the film. He added "I was up there in Toronto for the film festival, it was the talk of the festival." It seemed the reporter had seen The Skeleton Twins, based on his initial remarks. "This is not a traditional comedy, there are funny parts, but it's got a lot of layers."</p><p>After he asked the Ghostbusters actor about her "full-frontal nudity", Wiig and Hader mocked Parente for the mistake. He admitted he hadn't seen the film. Although the comedians were in stiches, and couldn't stop making jokes at Parente's expense, he played along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-design-(6).jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bill Hader And Kristen Wiig Completely Lost It During This 'SNL' Skit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bill Hader And Kristen Wiig Made "The Californians" Into One Of The Most Beloved Sketches On SNL.</span><p>"The two of you continue to crack me up," the reporter stated, speaking over the actors' uncontrollable laughter. He promised to catch their movie. "Trust me, I will be seeing it, when it opens in Denver," Parente said, before remarking, "It's in theaters this week! It's in theaters this week."</p><p>"Is his face red?" Hader wanted to know. "Yes, my face is red," Parente replied about his painfully awkward interview. "Thanks for that, appreciate it you two."</p><p>He handled himself well, and their interview was anything but boring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScYrWisMSrZJqmlGK4s7XSrZynZaeetqh5wpqjpZ2UYry2wIyaZKudoKS%2FtbHRZq6hp12srrR5wqWcmqqcrnq2us%2BrnKmZopqxbrLOq2StoJWev261za2cq66ZmsRw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./creme-brulee-pie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Creme Brle Pie  Modern Honey">&larr;
