Then less than two years later, their second child Ellie followed in October 2006.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Chip and Joanna Gaines' love story explained</figure><p id=eTVzIy6S2Rq6 data-wc=30>Speaking about parenthood in a 2021 interview with<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a>, Chip opened about the couple's first few years as parents, explaining that they'd viewed the whole experience as "a big adventure".</p><p id=e-Xh--7dXvbK data-wc=53>"Like anyone else we were scared to death because you have no idea what you're doing," the now 48-year-old admitted. "There were definitely great books out there but we thought, 'Hey, we could figure this out as good as anybody.' At the end of the day we really considered it a big adventure."</p><p id=egfEKl-C4uid data-wc=20><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Joanna Gaines' husband Chip's opinion on divorce as he opens up about their relationship - and it's so refreshing</a></p><p id=epQBC24D78FZ data-wc=56>He continued honestly: "I made every mistake in the book with Drake and Ella both… There's lots of stories of me leaving kids places I shouldn’t have left them. I've forgotten birthdays... But I'm a firm believer that it's the mistakes that make us who we are… and I think that goes for parenting as well."</p><p id=e__-yxM98kN9 data-wc=36>Joanna and Chip's third child, Duke, was born in May 2008, and then their second daughter, Emmie, followed in January 2010. The pair then waited eight years before having their fifth child, Crew, in June 2018.</p><p id=ekDU-yrXMHPr data-wc=60>During an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Oprah</a> in 2021, Joanna explained how the couple prioritise supporting each other in order to successfully raise their kids. "It's got to be in that priority, in our minds, in our heart and in our home, that we're healthy and whole so that our children, what trickles down to them, is health and wholeness as well."</p><h2><strong>How old are Joanna and Chip Gaines' kids?</strong></h2><p id=exOlT-_c5jz1 data-wc=26>Joanna and Chip's oldest son Drake is 18 years old. Ella is 16, Duke is 14, Emmie is 13, and their youngest child Crew is four.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0c44a06b4c94-1679411704382664708102052532531660537351115n.jpg><p id=erE31GwOyCmV data-wc=62>While Drake has shown a passion for TV production in the past, Joanna revealed that the couple's eldest daughter appears to share her interest in design. "I think she'll follow in my footsteps and have her hand in a lot of things," she told<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a> in 2019. "Right now she wants to cook, be a lead designer and have a donut truck."</p><p id=ebC1bSvFWCt5 data-wc=15><strong>SEE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Joanna Gaines and husband Chip's Fixer Upper farm which is set for big change</a></p><p id=e-l_bBh1BgHi data-wc=75>In the same interview, Joanna discussed how her children's shared interest in business exploits has also shown elements which they have in common with their father. Looking back to when Ella set up a baking stall in their garden and when Duke and Emmie began selling eggs from the family's chickens to neighbors, Joanna jokingly admitted: "Once a week they go out and sell… They're just like Chip: They don't take no for an answer!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b3c242123328-3317388027264107691964866271967331185535712n.jpg><p id=eUa9mfpqlz5U data-wc=47>Meanwhile, speaking then about their nine-month-old boy Crew (now four), Joanna joked: "I always tell Chip, 'This boy is going to be able to run the company by age 5!'" as a result of all the meetings he was taken to by his parents as a baby.</p><p id=ehXc4q57-I9H data-wc=17><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Fixer Upper star Joanna Gaines shares how she 'nurtured' herself back from a place of 'unbalance'</a></p><p id=ecqvfU1qU-TS data-wc=62>Joanna also talked to<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a> following the birth of Crew about having a baby after her almost 10-year-long break from having children. "I think it's sweet because [our kids are] older now, and I can see them wanting to be a part of this," she said. "We're all rallying around this baby, which I feel is a sweet gift to our family."</p><h2><strong>What happened to Chip and Joanna Gaines' oldest son?</strong></h2><p id=e00wsfnaLIr0 data-wc=24>The Magnolia network pair's eldest child will soon be fledging their<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;impressive Waco, Texas based home</a> in 2023 to go and study at college.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ehO5wSefjlwa data-wc=37>Writing in a blog post on her website the<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Magnolia Journal</a>, Joanna spoke about<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Drake's imminent journey</a> off to college in August 2022. "Soon, our oldest son, Drake, will be leaving home for college," her message began.</p><p id=euC8pBYrox-N data-wc=47>"In the grand scheme of heart-breaking things, this one comes with a lot of gratitude and excitement… But still, my first child is moving away, and our family dynamic will change because of it, and that can feel like a loss of its own," she penned emotionally.</p><h2><strong>Are Chip and Joanna expecting a sixth baby?</strong></h2><p id=euUchzf3cCzo data-wc=44>No, the couple are not expecting any more children at the moment. While<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Joanna's younger sister</a> Mikey has had six children with her husband, David McCall, the 44-year-old and her husband Chip appear to have decided to settle down with their family of five.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/809c1955cf40-gettyimages-1235323044.jpg><p id=eOQThu4eHUfL data-wc=38>Although the couple did welcome in the new year with the announcement of some<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;new additions to their family</a>, Joanna has spoken about how she is not planning to have any more children with Chip in the future.</p><p id=eJA6DSM0EHoy data-wc=47>But she hasn't completely ruled out the possibility of having a sixth child either. The Kansas-born host told<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;People</a> in 2018: "[Chip is] always joking that he wants [Crew] to have a little sister. No plans for another baby, but then again, we’ve never been planners anyway."</p><p id=ei6fES54nEv data-wc=40>However, Joanna has also opened up about how being pregnant aged 40 brought more challenges than she has faced in the past. "I was limping into work and I couldn’t breathe. At 40, it’s definitely a little different," she said.</p><p id=e_H9V9UETCQs data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
