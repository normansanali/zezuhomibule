It is a similarly nefarious character that fans want to see Dano portray if the Dune franchise continues.</p><h2 id=fans-think-that-paul-dano-would-make-a-perfect-scytale-in-a-potential-dune-3>Fans Think That Paul Dano Would Make A Perfect Scytale In A Potential Dune 3</h2><p>The character that fans want to see Paul Dano play in a future Dune film is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the villain Scytale</a>. Director Denis Villeneuve has expressed interest in making a third Dune film, based on Dune Messiah, the second novel in the Frank Herbert series from which the films were adapted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scytale serves as a pivotal antagonist in the film, who has the power to transform into other people. This skill relies on his understanding of his marks’s psychological makeup, enabling seamless integration into his assumed identity. He is depicted in the book as a Tleilaxu Face Dancer, deeply entrenched in a conspiracy against Paul Atreides.</p><p>Later on in the plot, he assumes the guise of Lichna, daughter of Fremen Otheym, to infiltrate the Atreides Keep and orchestrate a dangerous scheme. The character's name is believed to reflect this multifaceted nature, and draws from historical and zoological references.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dune-wouldn-t-have-been-made-without-timothee-chalamet-director-says-imdb.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Before Dune, Denis Villeneuve Turned Down Timothée Chalamet For A Film That Made $122 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Denis Villeneuve forgot that he turned away Timothee Chalamet before casting him in Dune.</span><p>Scytale's narrative extends beyond the initial Dune installment, however, featuring prominently in subsequent novels by Frank Herbert and continuation works by his son Brian, as well as Kevin J. Anderson. Martin McDougall portrayed the character in the 2003 miniseries Frank Herbert's Children of Dune.</p><h2 id=what-have-fans-said-about-paul-dano-as-scytale-in-a-possible-dune-messiah-film>What Have Fans Said About Paul Dano As Scytale In A Possible Dune Messiah Film?</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>The conversation about Paul Dano playing Scytale in a potential Dune Messiah film kicked off on Reddit, after one user suggested <a href=#><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a> for the role. A commenter responded, "Imagine my reaction seeing you say Ryan Gosling lol... When I really think about it, Paul Dano would be pretty cool."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan chimed in, stating, "Dano can be so calculating and scary, I can see this being amazing," while a different user emphatically added, "Always Paul Dano. Every time."</p><p>Dune: Part One was released in the United States on October 22, 2021, with the sequel premiering in London on February 15, 2024. In that time period, Dano has starred in a number of films. He played a voice role as Matthew Fontenot in <a href=#><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>'s The Guilty in 2021.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a-dune-2-actor-was-crushed-after-his-scene-in-the-film-didn-t-even-make-denis-villeneuve-s-deleted-scenes-front-deposit-back-imdb.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Dune 2 Actor Was Crushed After His Scene In The Film Didn't Even Make Denis Villeneuve's Deleted Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Denis Villeneuve was forced to make some tough decisions in the Dune: Part Two editing room.</span><p>He followed that up with The Batman, while also playing Steven Spielberg's dad in The Fabelmans, both in 2022. The following year, he portrayed financial analyst, investor and Redditor Keith Gill, in the 2023 biographical comedy-drama Dumb Money. He also voiced Hanuš, an extraterrestrial spider in the <a href=#><strong>Adam Sandler</strong></a> film Spaceman on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=when-could-a-potential-dune-messiah-film-be-released>When Could A Potential Dune Messiah Film Be Released?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dune-messiah-cover.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In April 2024, Entertainment Weekly reported on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the confirmation of a third Dune film</a>, based on the novel Dune Messiah. According to the same feature, Denis Villeneuve first told EW in 2021 that his goal all along was to make a trilogy of Dune movies.</p><h3 id=everything-we-know-about-dune-3-so-far>Everything We Know About Dune 3 So Far</h3><ul><li>In April 2024, it was confirmed that Legendary was already developing a third Dune movie.</li><li>Denis Villeneuve will reportedly take a break before continuing with the Dune Messiah adaptation, but confirms that work on the third installment is underway.</li><li>No new cast additions confirmed (as of March 2024).</li><li>(Reportedly) After Dune 3, Villeneuve and Legendary will turn their attentions to adapting Annie Jacobsen‘s nonfiction book Nuclear War: A Scenario.</li></ul><p>"I always envisioned three movies," the director said. "It's not that I want to do a franchise, but this is Dune, and Dune is a huge story. In order to honor it, I think you would need at least three movies. That would be the dream. To follow Paul Atreides and his full arc would be nice."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the confirmation, and ahead of Dune: Part Two's release, legendary composer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hans Zimmer (who scored both films) also revealed that he was already writing music for a third</a>. He also said that Villeneuve had actually completed and presented him with a copy of Dune Messiah, the movie.</p><p>That being said, as of March 2024, there had not even been communication about when production is expected to start. Consequently, fans might have to wait a few good years before they can enjoy Dune Messiah on the big screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibrqaVYoBur8Csq6Kml2K%2FtrnOq6pmqJGquW6wwKemaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fire-countrys-max-thieriot-has-at-least-3-more-spinoff-ideas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fire Country's Max Thieriot Has at Least 3 More Spinoff Ideas">&larr;
