But little did viewers know that this “gentle giant” would later go on to be arrested not once but twice for trying to engage in sexual acts with underage girls.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this “MTV Connor Smith Bio” to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Former MTV Star Connor Smith Allegations</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>There’s a warrant issued against the MTV star, Connor Smith for allegedly trying to engage in s*x acts with a girl under the age of 15.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As per Lake County Sheriff’s Office, Connor interacted with an undercover officer who was posing as a minor for “several weeks” online. After sending explicit videos and images of himself, he then drove to meet the minor on February 9, 2023, with intentions to engage in sexual acts.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He was apprehended by detectives at the pre-planned location. However, before he could be taken in, the star fled in his vehicle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, Connor now faces three felonies — traveling to meet a minor, grooming, and disseminating harmful material.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of Feb 17, Connor has yet to surrender. But a judge has already signed off on a $1 million bond after his arrest.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This news also comes 14 months after the former MTV star was arrested for allegedly beating and raping a 16-year-old girl. Back in December 2021, Connor was charged with one count of rape and sexual battery and two counts of criminal confinement in Cook County, Illinois.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The unidentified girl alleged that she was kidnapped from her room back in July after going to visit family members in Indiana. Reportedly, she’d exchanged Snapchat details with someone selling a cat and gave them the address of where she was staying.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Later, that evening, Connor “ripped open her bedroom window screen, yanked her out of the room, threw her into his truck, and drove to a motel while s*xually assaulting her.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, she changed her story later confessing that she met the alleged attacker on a dating app and voluntarily sneaked out to meet him. However, once in the man’s truck, she was forced to perform oral s*x on him while he drove them to the motel. She alleged he was “slapping and choking her multiple times, urinating on her in the motel room, and forcing oral s*x again.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The accuser also added that the man dropped her home and said he would be back the following day. But her family members waited on the front lawn and chased him away once he showed up again.</span></p><h3><b>Connor Smith Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Connor Smith was 32 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But he was only 24 when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MTV’s Are You The One?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 3.</span></p><h3><b>Connor Smith Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Connor Smith didn’t reveal his family members. But we do have their names — Annmarie P, Smith Sheila M Olofsson, Christy M Smith, Thomas J Olofsson, Harold W Olofsson, Michael J Robb, Ashley Smith, Michael J Robb, Jenna M Smith, Edward F Smith, Marilyn T Smith, and Donna M Smith.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, it was said that his mother didn’t meet her soulmate until she was 50.</span></p><h3><b>Is Connor Smith Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Connor Smith isn’t married.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, it didn’t seem like he was dating anyone in 2023.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His personal motto is “Live your dream!”</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>During </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MTV’s Are You The One?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> ep 5, Connor did uncover his perfect match with Chelsey, though the couple ultimately split following the show.</span></p><h3><b>Connor Smith Job Beyond MTV’s Are You The One?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Connor Smith appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>MTV’s Are You The One?</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> back in 2015 and won $37,500. But once he was out in the real world, he went back to his job as a model.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This reality started his modeling journey after one of his photographer/good friend, Reggie, introduced him to the modeling world. Given he had already been hitting the gym for over 3 years then and also working as a personal trainer and NPC physique bodybuilder for the past 2, he was loving his newfound career.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prior to modeling, Connor was a nonunion roofer who didn’t like his job at all.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Reportedly, he was a laborer at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fiber Drum Sales</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> then. And before that, he worked as an office manager at</span><i><span style=font-weight:400> Professional Physical Therapy</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and as a sales boy at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Contractor Supply</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Pet Land</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Connor’s not working, he likes to go fishing and drink.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for his education, Connor attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Amos Alonzo Stagg </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>from 2004 to 2008, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Moraine Valley Community College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from 2010 to 2014 for his associate’s degree, and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Chicago State University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> from 2013 to 2015 for his Bachelor’s degree in Psychology.</span></p><h3><b>Is Connor Smith On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sadly, after the scandal, Connor Smith deactivated his Instagram @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>therealconnorsmith678</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. His account was filled with posts about fitness,&nbsp; meal prep, fitness competitions, and training.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, you can still find him on Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>tweetconnor180</span></a></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Connor Smith Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Connor receives his birthday wishes on April 3 and is of the Aries zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Connor Smith From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>The reality star hails from Tinley Park, Illinois.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Tall Is Connor Smith?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Connor stands tall at a height of 6 feet 8 inches (203 cm) and weighs 165 kg (235 lbs).
