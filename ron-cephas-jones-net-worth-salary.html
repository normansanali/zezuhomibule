Created by Dan Fogelman, the series delves into the lives of the Pearson family across its three generations. Actors Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia play the family’s matriarch and patriarch respectively, while Justin Hartley, Chrissy Metz, and Sterling K. Brown play their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Little-Known Details About The Making Of 'This Is Us'</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, actor Ron Cephas Jones portrayed William Hill, one of the series’ most unforgettable supporting characters. And although William died towards the end of the first season, he’s remained a recurring character throughout its run. As a result, fans also can’t help but wonder how much the actor has made from working on the show.</p><h2 id=he-had-concerns-about-his-character-dying>He Had Concerns About His Character Dying</h2><p>Early on in the series, William’s death was already foreshadowed although Jones had no idea how far into the future that would occur. That was a choice he made when he signed on to join the cast. “So I decided not to specifically ask Dan about it and just let it play out however it plays out, and play every moment like I’m not coming back,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jones once told Entertainment Weekly</a>. “And that gives me sort of a sad undertow, of everything he does.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Major 'This Is Us' Moments, Ranked By How Much We Cried</a></span></p><p>And when the character was killed off early on, Jones admitted he had some concerns although Fogelman assured him it was all part of the show’s overall story arc. “I had the initial feeling I wasn’t going to have a job anymore!” the actor told TV Insider. “Dan Fogelman assured me that the character would continue to appear and we’d fill in blanks with [William] and the Pearsons and Randall.”</p><h2 id=the-emmy-he-won-from-working-on-the-show-was-extra-special>The Emmy He Won From Working On The Show Was Extra Special</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout his time in the series, Jones’ performance was praised by critics and fans alike, ultimately resulting in an Emmy nod for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. And when he returned as a recurring guest star in the series, the praises kept coming. Even better, Jones scored two Emmy wins for his work, most recently getting awarded in 2020.</p><p>For any series actor, winning an Emmy is always special. For Jones, however, his recent win was made extra sweet by the fact that his own daughter, Jasmine, also won an Emmy last year. “That’s pretty incredible,” Jones remarked. “Despite all the other obstacles, this has been a great year.”</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-how-much-he-made-from-this-is-us>Here’s How Much He Made From This Is Us</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the show started, the cast signed on with varying deals. And essentially, the salary was determined by the actor’s previous exposure in Hollywood and the type of role they have in the series. For instance, Moore, who plays a lead character, reportedly made $85,000 per episode during first season while Ventimiglia was reportedly paid $115,000 per episode. Meanwhile, Metz and Hartley got paid a reported $40,000 and $75,000 per episode respectively.</p><p>As for Jones, his salary was never disclosed but considering his veteran status as an actor, it is possible that he scored a deal that’s close to the lead stars. Just to point out, Jones previously starred in the award-winning series Mr. Robot. He was also starring in the <a href=#>Netflix</a> Marvel series Luke Cage around the same time he was working on This is Us.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Justin Hartley Reveals Jon Huertas Directed The Recent Episode Of ‘This Is Us’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, the series’ regulars famously negotiated for pay raises prior to the show returning for a third season. “The cast has gotten together and are demanding a huge pay increase,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider told the National Enquirer</a>. “They now consider themselves an ensemble, like the actors on <a href=#>Friends</a>, [who] earned $1 million per episode.” Following the negotiations, Moore, Ventimiglia, Metz, Brown, and Hartley reportedly got their rates increased to $250,000 per episode, which is inclusive of signing bonuses. As for Jones, it is possible that he never got to join the renegotiation since he had already left the series as a regular around this time. That said, it is possible that his Emmy as a guest star helped Jones secure a good deal for himself.</p><h2 id=he-says-the-final-season-will-lsquo-overwhelm-rsquo-fans>He Says The Final Season Will ‘Overwhelm’ Fans</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just a few months ago, it was reported that This Is Us will be ending its run after its upcoming sixth season. In the past, Fogelman had also made it clear that he never intended to create a show that would go on for decades. “We never set out to make a television series that was going to last 18 seasons,” he once told The Hollywood Reporter. “Like, we have a plan for what we’re going to do and I know what the plan is.”</p><p>Meanwhile, even if Jones’ character has appeared in the series even after his death, it remains unclear if fans will get to see more of William in flashbacks. So far, Jones has remained tight-lipped about this. When asked, the actor only told ET, “There could be a really great opportunity for that to happen.” “I think they got something coming that's sort of like, it's ‘gonna just overwhelm everyone,” he also teased. “You figure with all the different ends that need to be wrapped up between the inner family, the Pearsons, the uncle, they're just so many wonderful things that even came out this past season, all the surprises that went on.” The Emmy winner also confessed, “I think that it's gonna be even overwhelming for myself.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, there is no set release date for the show’s final season. However, it was previously announced that This is Us season six will air during the 2021 to 2022 broadcast season.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Milo Ventimiglia Didn't Think He Got The Role On 'This Is Us'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipqKZdmLKxtMCsZKOnnprAbrrErWSwp6KptW6%2FwKWYq7Ff</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./4-year-olds-body-unearthed-in-kentucky-forest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tragic: 4-Year-Olds Body Unearthed in Kentucky Forest">&larr;
