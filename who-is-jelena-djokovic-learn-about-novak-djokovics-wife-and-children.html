He has amassed 87 ATP singles victories, including 38 Masters events.</p><p>Novak is the first guy in the Open Era to earn a double career Grand Slam and the second man, after Don Budge, to complete a non-calendar year Grand Slam. Additionally, he is the only player on the ATP Tour to accomplish the Career Golden Masters.</p><h2 id=who-is-novak-djokovics-wi>Who Is Novak Djokovic's Wife Jelena Djokovic?

According to his attorneys, the 34-year-old tennis star was subsequently detained in an immigration detention facility in Melbourne, who claimed he was given a COVID-19 vaccine exemption.</p><p>He was recently freed from this facility on January 10, when he won his appeal. His wife, Jelena Djokovic, has publicly supported him on Twitter and Instagram throughout the scandal.</p><p>Jelena has consistently stood by him during his successful career, but she has also achieved success independently. This 35-year-old woman undoubtedly wears many different hats in addition to her duty as an ever-supportive wife at the courtside.</p><p><strong>You might also like:&nbsp;</strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener>Is Nick Kyrgios Muslim Or Jewish?
