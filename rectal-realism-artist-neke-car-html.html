Sure, it’s great that this painting is appearing for the first time in 28 years. But what’s the big deal? Carson painted it with a paintbrush sticking out of his butt. That’s the big deal. Carson, now 61, is the longtime co-curator of <a href=#>an eclectic, cult-following Tuesday-night performance series</a> at the Gershwin Hotel. He spoke to an utterly fascinated Vulture about his ass-tonishing conceptual art feat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-3-0-0@published data-word-count=61><strong>How did you meet Andy Warhol in the first place?</strong><br>He came and did his Exploding Plastic Inevitable show at RISD in the late sixties when I was a student. At the after-party, he said, “If you ever get to New York, come by the Factory.” That was a Tuesday or Wednesday, and by Friday I was knocking on the Factory door.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-4-0-0@published data-word-count=117><strong>What was the Factory like?</strong><br>Warhol come out and was very nice and then went back to work, and I watched what they all were doing. That night we went to some club, and I realized that I really hadn’t planned this whole thing. Typically they didn’t let people stay overnight at the Factory, but Billy Name was very nice and let it slide for one night. Once I graduated, I went right back and showed Andy my sculpture of a clear Plexiglas fountain. He said, “Why don’t you just leave it here?” Eventually it got reviewed in <i>Time</i>, and that was because of Andy. People don’t understand that about him, that he would do things like that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-5-0-0@published data-word-count=15><strong>So moving on to 1972…</strong><br>I was working on a new form of portraiture, Rectal Realism.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-6-0-0@published data-word-count=134>This was the era of body art, and it was sort of a parody of that. I watched a lot of kung fu movies, and in one, the guy gets so angry, he thrusts his hand into a wall and pulls out the sword. I wanted to do something like that with a pen or pencil, and finally my wife at the time said, “Why don’t you just stick it up your ass and be done with it?” And I thought, you have a point there. My first idea was an El Marko, but it was way too big and had a big stopper at the end. So I tried it out with a paintbrush and Pentels. I’d dip one end into rubber latex so you could kind of grip them in a way.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-7-0-0@published data-word-count=56><strong>Could you see your work as you did it?</strong><br>I had to do it upside down and backwards, lifting my crotch. When I started Andy’s portrait, I made his eyes too far apart and he was very upset. The Factory people were filming it as I did it. [The film will be part of the new exhibition.]</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-8-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>How did you control the strokes?</strong><br>With my legs. My idea was, your hand is way too sophisticated to make art. This had much less baggage, to get this eye-ass coordination going. You had to rewire your brain, go from your eyes to your butt instead of your arms. I don’t know if it helped that I was dyslexic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-9-0-0@published data-word-count=26><strong>Did it feel good or painful?</strong><br>It was pretty neutral because I went for a thin Pentel. It was like a thermometer. Does a thermometer feel good?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-10-0-0@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-10-0-1@published data-word-count=97>Neke Carson’s Portrait of Andy Warhol.Courtesy of the artist<br><strong>What was Andy like during the sitting?</strong><br>You should see the tape, which I’m going to play piano to on Friday. It was such a hard job, there was no time for small talk. It was probably a 40-minute session. And we were sort of having a contest to see who could be more deadpan about it. Once he saw that it wasn’t a joke, that sort of relaxed the situation. He asked me if I had to go to the bathroom. And I said not really. I’d prepared myself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-11-0-0@published data-word-count=12><strong>What did he think of the results?</strong><br>He said, “Oh, it looks great.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-12-0-0@published data-word-count=79><strong>Then the painting was briefly stolen in 1979.</strong><br>It was part of a punk-art show in Washington. Someone came into the gallery and took it home and put it in his room. The police put out a call for it on the radio. Finally this guy turned it in. I took a train down to Washington and painted him a small picture of the portrait and gave it to him. I wasn’t angry. He was like a big, giant kid.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-fabfd3de0ec7e70d8af208435217facc-13-0-0@published data-word-count=14><strong>Have you done Rectal Realism in recent years?</strong><br>No. That’s a young man’s game.<br>—Tim Murphy</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>‘Rectal Realism’ Artist Neke Carson on the Long-Lost Portrait of Warhol He Painted With His Butt</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncWdgaHyzscKtmKWXopqurbXSppaaqqSewLWrzZ6inpeTlr9vtNOmow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-word-power-by-super-why.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Meaning Behind The Song: Word Power by Super Why!">&larr;
