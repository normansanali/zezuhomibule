He’d planned the flowers, the make-up, the hair. Luckily I had a dress with me but it was covered in cats, so it was a bit of an unusual wedding dress. I'd&nbsp;bought it in a sale on a whim, so it was meant to be.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He'd proposed the year before, and we went up in a helicopter and got married on top of a mountain.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was suffering from extreme morning sickness, so although it’s meant to be the happiness day of your life, and it was, I also wanted to vomit at every turn!

Because he had to do a lot of speaking as CEO, he noticed early on his tongue didn’t feel right.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Initially he was checked for acid reflux and things like that, but the eventual diagnosis was ALS, which neither of us knew much about aside from the Ice Bucket Challenge which was to raise money for it. It was a really tough time, plus obviously I had the extreme morning sickness to contend with.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There was something almost poetic in the fact Sean's life was ending and Minty’s life was beginning.&nbsp;I think the fact we had Minty was actually a bit of a saviour and prolonged his life in a way, because a baby brings so much joy, everyone had something wonderful to focus on.
