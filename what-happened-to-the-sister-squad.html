They both made a bunch of videos which brought the drama to new heights, and it was, well, a lot.</p><p><a href=#>James also was involved in a feud with fellow makeup icon, Jeffree Starr,</a> who basically accused James of being a predator, and for flirting with straight men like Grayson Dolan. Each of these feuds and controversies were most likely a lot to keep up with —&nbsp;and uncomfortable for the other Sisters —&nbsp;so we can kind of understand if they had wanted to take a step back from James and all of his YouTuber drama.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/HV3p4SzP-/200x200/57959ffe-e9a8-4caf-875e-c9e934a054dc-1562084694111.jpg><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In Emma's podcast, she's mentioned her first friends in Los Angeles weren't her "real friends."</h2><p>On Emma's podcast, Anything Goes, the YouTube star discusses various topics, from high school, to relationships, and intuitions. In one episode, which was titled Los Angeles, she discussed what it was like to move to the city at only 17 years old, which was, as we all know, when she started to become friends with the Dolans and James.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I moved here and I had a few people I kind of knew... they kind of took me under their wing which was super sweet, because they didn't have to do that, but even though I had these kind of friend groups I was in, it was still kind of lonely because I didn't have a best friend... I was kind of the outsider... it wasn't like I was texting these people about my feelings," she said.</p><p>While it isn't confirmed she was referring to the Sister Squad, we know that was her main group of friends at the time. So there's a chance they were never quite as close as we thought they were.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Emma and Ethan may have had a "thing."</h2><p>For a while, there were also rumors that <a href=#>Ethan and Emma were secretly dating</a>. This has not been confirmed by either party, but fans are convinced they dated for the majority of 2018. She had a photo of the two of them, hugging, on her wall, they spent July 4 together, and Ethan posted about her to Instagram more than once.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At one point in January 2019, an internet troll accused Emma of having crusty lips, and Ethan immediately defended her honor, tweeting, "Her lips deffffintely aren't crusty," which implied they had kissed. Needless to say, we definitely think they dated and have since broken up, which could have ultimately ruined their friendship.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It seems like Emma and the Dolans are doing just fine.</h2><p>People thought that <a href=#>James may have thrown shade at Emma</a> last year when someone on an Instagram Live video suggested he go hang out with Emma, and he responded "ew." He, however, has since said he didn't mean anything by it... but we aren't convinced.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>There are a lot of factors that could have contributed to the end of the Sister Squad, and regardless of what happened, we miss their collabs... they were truly the friend group we all wanted to be a part of.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJViwKq%2F056pZquhqq6l</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./boxing-news-while-everyone-is-in-denial-floyd-mayweather-gets-roped-in-as-his-promotions-ceo-reveals-advantage-jermell-charlo-has-over-canelo-alvarez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="While Everyone Is in Denial, Floyd Mayweather Gets Roped In as His PromotionsCEO Reveals Advanta">&larr;
