Jordan and Yvette Prieto are reported to have met in a nightclub in 2008, and it was not long before they moved in together, People Magazine reports.</p><p>In 2011, they got engaged, and two years later they were married. It was a big celebration that was held in Florida with 500 guests in attendance. There was also no expense spared to make this one of the most memorable days of their lives. Why?

"Michael loves Yvette, but he won't let that interfere with his common sense – and his money – like it did before," a source said at the time.</p><p>he would keep her assets before the marriage, and it was reported that she would receive $ 1 million for every year they were married if they were to divorce (they have been together ten years now). The sum is reported to increase after ten years of marriage from $1 million to $5 million.</p><p>The source claimed Yvette Prieto was happy with the agreement and believed that their relationship was made to last. "She feels they have a strong relationship. She can't imagine that they'd ever split up!" the insider said.</p><p>"Yvette knows Michael was once a serial cheater, just like his buddy Tiger Woods. But she believes Michael has sown his wild oats and only has eyes for her now. They're both very happy and looking forward to the wedding."
