From there, he has purchased his own launch wagon, and he went on to own several local bars and restaurants. Mike tried to develop a pillow, and it took one year to make a perfect pillow.</span></p><p><span>He tried to sell a pillow, and all the company turned down offered.

On 16 January 2009, he was sober from his addiction, and he got his business blooming.</span></p><p><span>In 2011, his business started to uprising due to the attention he gets from the media. Since then, he sold&nbsp;30 million pillows, and revenues have grown from around $100,000 a year to close to $300 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lindell’s dream come true has had a couple of nightmares in the last year.
