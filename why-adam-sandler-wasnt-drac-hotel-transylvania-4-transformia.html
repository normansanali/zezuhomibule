Titled Hotel Transylvania: Transformania, the movie takes fans on another adventure with Drac and his gang as they return to the hotel and find the place full of mayhem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Iconic Actress Won't Shoot A Film With Adam Sandler</a></span></p><p>The bad news is, this means <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of the Hotel Transylvania is coming </a>as Sony Pictures decided to put the franchise to bed with this film. With this new movie come some major changes in story, production and in casting that fans are slowly adjusting to. Will the fourth installment find the same success as the previous films? To sum it up, here's everything we know about Hotel Transylvania 4.</p><p><strong>Updated on February 8, 2022: </strong>When this article was originally published, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania was set for a theatrical release in October 2021. However, plans changed and its release was pushed back, and ultimately the film was released as an Amazon Prime Video streaming exclusive in January 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film received mediocre reviews from critics and it currently has a 52% score on Rotten Tomatoes. Some reviewers felt that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film was missing something without the voice of Adam Sandler</a>, even though Brian Hull does a good job filling in for him as Drac. That being said, Hotel Transylvania: Transformania still had plenty of star power, with the likes of Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez in two of the main roles. Adam Sandler and Kevin James have still yet to give an explanation as to why they did not return for the fourth and final instalment in the franchise.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-story-of-39-hotel-transylvania-4-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>What Is The Story Of 'Hotel Transylvania 4'?</span></h2><p>As Dracula and co head back at the Hotel, Abraham Van Helsing introduces the "Monsterification Ray," a device that turns any human into a monster and vice versa. Terrified, Dracula must become a human, be stripped of his powers, and travel across the world to find a cure to stop this machine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=production-of-39-hotel-transylvania-4-39-took-place-remotely-during-the-pandemic><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Production Of 'Hotel Transylvania 4' Took Place Remotely During The Pandemic</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Hotel-Transylvania-4.jpg><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic battered every corner of the world, Sony Pictures staffers were forced to work remotely from home. Many animated productions, such as Tom & Jerry, SpongeBob's upcoming Patrick Star spin-off, Sing 2, and even Hotel Transylvania 4 have been at least partially produced remotely from home.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-served-as-an-executive-producer><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Selena Gomez Served As An Executive Producer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to voicing Drac's daughter Mavis, singer <strong>Selena Gomez </strong>will also serve as an executive producer of the film. In fact, the former Disney star has also shepherded several big films and series including The Big Short, The Dead Don't Die, Fundamentals of Caring, The Broken Hearts Gallery, and 13 Reasons Why.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Iconic Video Game Franchise Nearly Got A Blockbuster Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=no-adam-sandler-is-not-in-the-film><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>No, Adam Sandler Is Not In The Film</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, Adam Sandler did not return to voice Dracula. He has been the voice behind the iconic character since the first Hotel Transylvania film hit the screen in 2012. It's still unclear why Sandler didn't return to the project, but he has been keeping himself busy with several projects. Recently, his production company Happy Madison is wrapping up the production of Netflix's upcoming sports drama Home Team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-was-a-new-dracula-voice-in-39-hotel-transylvania-4-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>There Was A New Dracula Voice In 'Hotel Transylvania 4'</span></h2><p>To replace Sandler, Sony Pictures hired Brian Hull. This isn't Hull's first involvement with the franchise, as he previously voiced the character in the short film Monster Pets.</p><p>"I have huge news to deliver to y'all, that I have been holding in for far too long!" he said on his YouTube channel. "But the trailer just got dropped today and I can finally talk about it. I am going to be the voice of Dracula for the fourth Hotel Transylvania movie: Hotel Transylvania: Transformania!

Kevin James, who previously voiced the monster Frankenstein in the first three films, will not reprise his voice role. He was replaced by Brad Abrell, who's best known for portraying the Bubble Buddy and King Neptune in the SpongeBob SquarePants franchise.</p><h2 id=derek-drymon-replaced-genndy-tartakovsky-in-the-director-39-s-seat-of-39-hotel-transylvania-4-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Derek Drymon Replaced Genndy Tartakovsky In The Director's Seat Of 'Hotel Transylvania 4'</span></h2><p>Genndy Tartakovsky directed the prior three films, but he did not return as director for the fourth film.

Kathryn Hahn played Ericka, Drac's wife, Steve Buscemi returned as the werewolf Wayne, David Spade portrayed Griffin, and Keegan-Michael Key played the mummy Murray. In addition, you can also hear Molly Shannon's voice as Wanda just like in the previous three films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-39-hotel-transylvania-39-franchise-has-amassed-a-whopping-1-3-billion><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The 'Hotel Transylvania' Franchise Has Amassed A Whopping $1.3 Billion</span></h2><p>The first three films of Hotel Transylvania were such a massive success for Sony Pictures, and it makes us sad how the franchise has finally come to an end.
