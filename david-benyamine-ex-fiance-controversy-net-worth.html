He was born and raised in Napoleon, Degenyamine of France.</p><p>His father’s name and his mother’s name have not been made public. Neither has any information about their whereabouts or profession ever been out.</p><p>David has not ever talked about his childhood much. But he was interested in sports and was very athletic.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no information about which high school David went to. But it has been confirmed that he has graduated from high school.&nbsp;</p><p>David was interested in poker from a young age. He used to watch shows about poker on his cable television for hours.&nbsp;</p><p>By the age of twelve, the poker player had already learned the basics of poker. However, he never considered it to be his primary interest and focus in life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=david-benyamine-personal-life></span>David Benyamine: Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David is a French citizen. Moreover, he is of Christian faith and is of European descent.</p><p>Being born in July, Benyamine is a Cancer, a water sign, and they are emotional.&nbsp;</p><p>Cancer people have traits such as being loyal, humble, kind, intelligent, and empathetic.</p><p>David is the perfect example of cancer for their extroverted side since he loves to be surrounded by people and meet new faces.&nbsp;</p><p>Benyamine is not a flashy person like other people in poker. Instead, he likes to keep it simple and lowkey.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to his dating life, David prefers to keep it out of the media limelight. This is because he does not enjoy the attention of the media in his love life.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=relationships></span>Relationships<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>David has kept most of his past relationships away from the media. But his relationship with Erica Schoenberg became one of the biggest news.&nbsp;</p><p>Erica is an American professional blackjack and poker player. Along with that, she is also a fitness trainer and former model.</p><p>Erica does not joke when it comes to poker and has been trained by the MIT Blackjack team. She went on to win second place at the women’s World Poker Tour event.</p><p>Since Erica and David run in similar circles, they met at one of the events. Just after talking, they were interested in each other and started dating.</p><p>The chemistry between them because of the common shared love of poker was through the roof.&nbsp;</p><p>So when David popped out the ring, Erica said yes without any hesitation. The couple seemed to be happy and were loyal to each other.</p><p>But soon, the reality of relationships hit, and they started having problems. They started having arguments, and soon, their differences became irreconcilable.&nbsp;</p><p>They broke off the engagement and went their own ways. To this day, they have not revealed the exact reason for their separation.</p><p>After this, David stayed single and started focusing on his career.</p><p>But Erica soon moved on with a different poker player named Erick Lindgren. And this time, the couple reached the alter and tied the knot on the 29th of May in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Together the couple had one child. But their relationship was considered to be one of the worst in the poker world.</p><p>David Benyamine also has a daughter from a previous relationship. He has not revealed the name of the mother yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=david-benyamine-professional-career></span>David Benyamine: Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After starting his career as a professional tennis player, David got injured in his back, leading him to retire from the sport.</p><p>He was rather confused on which career path to take that is when he decided to choose poker.</p><p>So David started playing five-card draw poker, which he defines to be his least favorite variant now.</p><p>He started playing in the Texas no hold’em cash games. Benyamine won his first competition in 1999, which was Autumn Tournament in Paris.</p><p>Starting from 2002, he played in the No-Limit Hold’em Tournament at the prestigious Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. Then, he played in the big game for two and half days straight.</p><p>David used to be a cash game player until 2008 when his friends encouraged him to play in more tournaments.&nbsp;</p><p>Benyamine also started playing the Full Tilt online server until the site was closed down.</p><p>In 2001, Benyamine was at the final table of the WPT, where he won the Grand Prix de Paris event. His victory was topped off with a four hundred thousand dollar reward.</p><p>He has won the Premier League of Poker IV. He has also won the World Poker Tour Battle of Champions II, which was an invitational event.&nbsp;</p><p>Just from his live tournaments, he had earned almost eight million US dollars.</p><p>Similarly, in 2008, one of his biggest achievements came when he won his first bracelet at the WSOP after finishing the Omaha HiLo Spilt.</p><p>He also finished in third at the Aussie Super High Roller NHLE Event, the biggest single live tournament game.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=david-benyamine-controversy></span>David Benyamine: Controversy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Benyamine has not been caught in many controversies throughout his career. But he found himself amidst one in 2011.</p><p>He was alleged to have a debt to the Full Tilt Red company, which dated back all the way to 2008.</p><p>From the statement from his account, it was shown that a lot of money was being deducted from his salary as soon as it landed there.</p><p>The deductions were made under ‘Loan collection.’ Even with his half a million salary in 2011, he was not nearly debt-free and was still paying.</p><p>This controversy arose when Full Tilt was unable to pay its users and owed a lot of money to the customers. It said that it had a sizeable amount of money coming from some of the big players in the game.</p><p>While Benyamine was still able to access his account and take out money under travel expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Other users were angry since their accounts had been frozen up until April of 2011. The hearing for reimbursement was postponed in September of that year.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Stefan Everts: Family, Malaria & Net Worth>></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=david-benyamine-net-worth></span>David Benyamine: Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David has earned not only fame for himself but also fortune.</p><p>He mainly earns from his tournament winnings which are hundreds of thousands.&nbsp;</p><p>david benyamine has an estimated net worth of 5 million us dollars as of 2022.</p><p>His exact salary is not known because poker is a game where tables can turn any minute.</p><p>However, just from his live poker tournaments, he has earned 2.5 million US dollars.</p><p>David is not a show-off and does not flex his wealth in front of others.</p><p>It seems that David is living a comfortable life with his earnings in his residence in Nevada.</p><p>&lt;&lt;Cardi B Net Worth: Cars, Income & Lifestyle>></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=david-benyamine-physical-appearance></span>David Benyamine: Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no information about David’s height and weight.</p><p>David has a healthy and huge body.
