The American rapper grew up without many friends but a strong family foundation. They all cared about him and always helped him when he was down. While his father acted as an idol for him, his mother taught him how to sing and helped him get ready to perform in a choir.</p><p>Krizz was mainly devoted to his sister, who frequently used a knife or a gun to fend off bullies.
