What happened to his arm and leg?</h2><p>Before Tom shared the photo of him from the hospital bed, he announced his injury on Twitter. He revealed that he had hurt himself on Dec. 1, and that it was so serious that he would have to cancel his upcoming comedy performances.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was injured yesterday and it really sucks," he tweeted on Dec. 2. "I can't move. Multiple broken bones. Unfortunately this means I will not be able to do my shows this weekend in Phoenix. We are looking at rescheduling dates now. Will announce them when I can."</p><p>Some of Tom's followers then began speculating online about what caused his injuries. He later confirmed that he got hurt while playing basketball with fellow comedian, Bert Kreischer.</p><p>"What challenge were you and @BertKreishcher doing that caused this?" one follower asked.</p><p>"Basketball," Tom replied, along with an emoji of a man holding his hands up.&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to specify that he was dunking when he got hurt, and that he was the only person to blame for what happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Tom also joked that he was going to get rid of his basketball sneakers. Much to the satisfaction of some of his followers, Tom confirmed that he had a recording of the moment that he got hurt.</p><p>Two days after the initial accident, Tom revealed that he was set to undergo surgery. He did not mention what the exact operation was, but he did note he was thankful to his fans for their support.</p><p>"Thank you for all the messages," he tweeted on Dec. 3. "Surgery tomorrow!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Disgraceful personality did continue to keep his fans updated on his health, but he stayed true to form and make a few jokes along the way. His Instagram post appeared to show Tom post-surgery, and he had a knee brace and a wrist brace on.</p><p>"Thanks for all the messages. I'm moving along in recovery," he wrote in the caption. "These are just the issues one has when you're really really really strong."</p><p>To promote a New Year's event that he is hosting, Tom shared two photos on Twitter of his post-surgery incisions and sutures. The photos are graphic in nature, and they further confirm the severity of his injuries.</p><p>Those who are really interested in finding out how Tom was injured may be in luck. The comedian has shared that he will post the video on New Year's Day. He also gave fans a glimpse of what happened in a recent YouTube post.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tom teased the moment he got injured in Tristan Jass' YouTube video.</h2><p>Further insight about Tom Segura's accident was shared in a YouTube video posted by basketball trick shot expert Tristan Jass.</p><p>At the end of the "1v2 Basketball Against Bert Kreischer & Tom Segura! (Hilarious)" video, Tristan showed a clip of an ambulance arriving to the basketball court.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>While some fans may have thought that Tom was joking about the dunking accident, it appears to be true.&nbsp;</p><p>He was seen leaving the area in a gurney, but the exact moment of his injury will be saved for Part 2.
