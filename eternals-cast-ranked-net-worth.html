We may have had to say goodbye to icons like Iron Man, Captain America, and Black Widow, but that was just gearing fans up for a new generation of superheroes.

Marvel introduced us to television series like WandaVision, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, Loki, What If, and on November 24, Hawkeye. We finally got to see Scarlett Johannson star in her first solo film, Black Widow, and meet martial arts legend Shang-Chi . Now we will finally meet the legendary Eternals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Angelina Jolie And Salma Hayek's Relationship</a></span></p><p>The Eternals were sent to Earth by the Celestials to fight against the evil Deviants and defend all of humanity.
