With four National Basketball Association (NBA) championships and four Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards to his name, he is widely regarded as one of the best players to have ever played basketball.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Having joined the NBA&nbsp;in 2003, James has dominated the sport for over fifteen years. And at 36, he is still in as good a shape as he was in his prime. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To deliver the performance expected of a star player like him, James goes the extra mile to ensure that his body can keep up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>From diet and exercise, to how he deals with injuries and recovery, the Lakers’ shooting guard is immaculate about taking care of his body.</p><h2>James Takes Care of His Body Religiously</h2><p>Aside from being one of the most gifted players physically, James also has a basketball IQ that’s off the charts. But those aren’t the only reasons he has been so successful - what sets him apart from others is his longevity.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite having spent a fair time on the court, James’s performance has always been remarkably consistent. And the secret to his consistency is the way he takes care of himself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On top of his strict work ethic, he is also willing to spend on his health and fitness. A&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2016 report</a>&nbsp;estimated that James spent $1.5 million on his body every year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The NBA star’s house is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">equipped </a>with&nbsp;a gym, ice tub, and hot tub, as well as a hyperbaric chamber. He also has a team dedicated to helping him stay in top shape. The team comprises a recovery coach, trainers, biochemists, personal chefs, masseuses, and nutritionists.</p><p>NBA player Kevin Durant, after working out with James, said that the latter took care of his body exceedingly well. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He knows that in order for him to play that long, his body has to be up. He has to keep that in shape. Like, he works on his body, like, religiously.</p><h2>Diet & Workout</h2><p>When&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speaking</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;GQ, Mike Mancias, James’s longtime trainer, shared the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four-time</a>&nbsp;NBA MVP’s diet.</p><p>James eats about five times a day: a traditional breakfast with turkey bacon or turkey sausage, lunch, and dinner with a couple of snacks placed between those meals.</p><p>The snacks primarily comprise dehydrated fruits with mixed nuts and a protein shake. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mancias also revealed that James’s diet wasn’t always this way, and that they had adjusted many things to fit him better. For example, the star stays away from red meat and pork now.</p><p>But while James’s nutritionist and chef prepare a well-planned diet for him, he doesn’t shy away from indulging a little now and then.</p><p>He is a wine aficionado and often has a chocolate chip cookie to break from his usual diet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As for his workout, James shared his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">workout routine</a>&nbsp;during quarantine on&nbsp;Instagram. The routine included three sets of every exercise listed below:</p><ul><li>Kneeling cable push/pull 8 each side</li><li>10 pushups</li><li>ball crunch with squeeze</li><li>3 point renegade row (8 each)</li><li>10 Kneeling cable reverse fly</li><li>10 Lateral band walks</li><li>8 Standing barbell curls</li></ul><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>LeBron James's workout routine</strong> (Image: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">James's Instagram</a>)</p><p>The routine also had six rounds of 30 seconds sprint and three rounds of 30 seconds 1 leg mat balance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Aside from diet and workout, James has stressed the importance of sleep. In an episode of the podcast&nbsp;The Tim Ferriss Show, the NBA star explained that the best recovery was to get eight and, if possible, nine hours of sleep every day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwuMSbqaimXZ%2BurrHSZq6oqpukwrV5w6KcrWWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblah7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lil-mos-dating-and-marriage-history-is-she-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Mos Dating And Marriage History: Is She Married?">&larr;
