openly bragging about celebs he would claim to know.</p><p>Another Andrew accuser <a href=#>Johanna Sjoberg</a> - who claimed the Prince groped her - also testified that Epstein told her Clinton "likes them young" when talking about girls.</p><p>One 2014 court filing listed on page 129 of the unsealed documents alleges that Maxwell "facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a ‘madame’ for Epstein".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>It goes on to claim that Jane Doe 3, understood to be Giuffre, was kept as a sex slave by Epstein and was "forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations."</p><p><strong>It comes as...</strong></p><ul><li>More than 900 new pages of Epstein documents were revealed by a US judge</li><li>Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking and Michael Jackson were among 90 people named in the documents</li><li>More docs are expected to be released in the coming days - with another 80 or so <a href=#>names set to be unveiled</a></li><li>Other names featured in the documents include <a href=#>Leonardo Dicaprio, Cate Blanchett and Bruce Willis</a></li><li>Most of those named in the document are not accused of any wrongdoing and are just passing mentions</li><li><a href=#>Jackon is alleged to have visited Epstein</a> at his mansion in New York</li><li>Epstein is claimed to have offered a reward to disprove claims Hawking took part in an 'underage orgy'</li><li>And the paedophile trafficker is alleged to have told a victim that Clinton "likes them young"</li><li>Another 'mystery prince' is mentioned - but not named in the docs</li><li>Ghislaine Maxwell claimed that Andrew had visited <a href=#>Epstein's infamous 'Paedo Island'</a></li><li>She also whinged questions about Prince Andrew go "on and on" in an email</li></ul><p>The alleged incidents happened "in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls)."</p><p>The unsealed docs claim Epstein told Jane Doe 3 to "give the Prince whatever he demanded".</p><p>He also allegedly "required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse".</p><p>Jane Doe 3, according to the filing, was trafficked to "foreign presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders".</p><p>Giuffre has previously claimed she was forced to have sex with Andrew in three separate locations, including in an orgy on Epstein's island.</p><p>In a transcript of her deposition, <a href=#>Maxwell claims Andrew only ever visited Epstein's 'paedo' island once</a>.</p><p>She added that no girls were present during the prince's visit - only female staff.</p><p>The documents quoting Maxwell read: "There were no girls on the island at all. No girls, no women, other than the staff who work at the house.</p><p>"Girls meaning, I assume you are asking underage, but there was nobody female outside of the cooks and the cleaners."</p><p>And she denied ever "at any time, at anyplace, in any moment ever asked Virginia Roberts or whatever she is called now to have sex with anybody."</p><p>Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and told the BBC in 2019 that he had never met <a href=#>Virginia Giuffre</a>.</p><p>Maxwell also said under oath that she "did not recall" being in London with Giuffre (then Roberts) and Andrew - despite photographs showing the three together.</p><p>The documents also revealed that Epstein told Maxwell she could offer money to Giuffre's friends if they were to "help prove" the accusations "were false".</p><p>Meanwhile, in a 2015 email, Epstein appears to say that Giuffre had claimed scientist Stephen Hawking had taken part in an 'underage orgy'.</p><p>His email reads: "You can issue a reward to any of Virginia’s friends, acquaints, family that come forward and help prove her allegations are false.</p><p>"The strongest is the Clinton dinner, and the new version in the Virgin Islands that Stephen Hawking participated in an underage orgy."</p><p>All of the unsealed legal information comes from the 2015 civil lawsuit filed by Giuffre against Maxwell for defamation.</p><p>It came after Maxwell's spokesperson described Giuffre's allegations against her and Epstein as "obvious lies".</p><p>Giuffre later launched a&nbsp;<a href=#>legal battle against</a>&nbsp;Prince Andrew in 2021, accusing him of sexually abusing her at Epstein’s mansion and raping her when she was 17.</p><p>She also alleged in court documents she was recruited by&nbsp;<a href=#>Maxwell</a>, 61, as a teenage “sex slave” for&nbsp;<a href=#>Epstein</a>.</p><p>Wednesday's unsealed pages also showed transcripts where <a href=#>Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with another mystery prince</a>.</p><p>In one email from Maxwell released in this most recent set of documents, she expresses concern to her lawyers and says she is "out of her depth".</p><p>"Statements that don't address all just lead to more questions. What is my relationship to Clinton? Andrew? On and on," she writes.</p><p>In another round of her deposition, Maxwell denied Clinton ever visited the infamous island but she said he did have a meal on Epstein’s plane.</p><p>She said "the allegation that Clinton had a meal on Jeffrey' s island is 100 percent false" before adding "I'm sure he had a meal on Jeffrey's plane."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Ghislaine Maxwell on Prince Andrew</h3></p><p>Question: Were you present on the island when Prince Andrew visited?</p><p>Maxwell: Yes.</p><p>Q: How many times?</p><p>Maxwell: I can only remember once.</p><p>Q: Were there any girls under the age of 18 on the island during that one visit that you remember that were not family or friends of or daughters of your friends?</p><p>Maxwell: There were no girls on the island at all. No girls, no women, other than the staff who work at the house. Girls meaning, I assume you are asking underage, but there was nobody female outside of the cooks and the cleaners.</p><p><a href=#>Johanna Sjoberg</a>, 42,&nbsp;claims that in March 2001, when she was 21,&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrew groped her breast</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=#>Epstein’s New York mansion</a>&nbsp;while playing with a&nbsp;<a href=#>Spitting Image puppet of himself</a>.</p><p>In transcript of her witness testimony released on Wednesday, <a href=#>Sjoberg</a> discusses her ordeal and observations about Virginia Giuffre's age also during a New York trip with Epstein.</p><p>Meanwhile, Giuffre claimed in her suit against Andrew in 2021 that he had raped her at Epstein's New York mansion when she was 17.</p><p>Sjoberg said Maxwell asked her to join her, Epstein, Prince Andrew and Giuffre in the living room of Epstein's home when she arrived.</p><p>Maxwell allegedly later asked Sjoberg to follow her to a closet, where she "grabbed the puppet, the puppet of Prince Andrew".</p><p>Sjoberg's transcript goes on: "And we went down -- back down to the<br>living room, and she brought it in.</p><p>"It was just funny because -- he thought it was funny because it was him.</p><p>"I just remember someone suggesting a photo, and they told us to go get on the couch.</p><p>"And so Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet, the puppet on her lap.</p><p>"And so then I sat on Andrew's lap, and I believe on my own volition, and they took the puppet's hands and put it on Virginia's breast, and so Andrew put his on mine."</p><p>In the documents unsealed on Wednesday, Sjoberg is further quoted as saying that she believed Giuffre was just 17 during a trip to Epstein's mansion in New York.</p><p>In transcript of her witness testimony, <a href=#>Sjoberg</a> said she knew Giuffre was underage then because she could not get into a casino.</p><p>The group had reportedly been redirected to Atlantic City before landing in New York, when Epstein, according to Sjobert's testimony, had said he'd get in touch with <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>Sjoberg is quoted as saying: "Jeffrey said, Great, we'll call up Trump and we'll go to -- I don't recall the name of the casino, but -- we'll go to the casino.</p><p>She went on: "All I knew is that she was not going to be allowed to gamble, and so I spent time with her.</p><p>"Because either she didn't have an ID or she was too young."</p><p>Describing Giuffre, Sjoberg apparently dubbed her as "orphan-like".</p><p>"At the time I had the impression that she did<br>not have a family or she had walked away from her family.</p><p>"And it seemed to me, you know, they had just sort of adopted her, not as a child, but they would take care of her," Sjoberg said during testimony.</p><p>In the transcript of her witness testimony, <a href=#>Sjoberg</a> was asked if she ever met anyone famous while with Epstein.</p><p>She said she <a href=#>met Michael Jackson at Epstein's house in Palm Beach</a> - but insisted their relationship was not sexual.</p><p>Names of Epstein and Maxwell's victims, associates and alleged co-conspirators will continue to be made public as part of the document dump, according to Preska's order.</p><p>Only Epstein and Maxwell have been charged over the alleged&nbsp;sexual abuse of dozens of young girls&nbsp;in his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005.</p><p>Giuffre's defamation lawsuit in 2015 was settled - but some of those involved in the trial were identified in the ruling through links to interviews they had previously given.</p><p>Judge Preska cited this as a reason for why their identities should not remain sealed.</p><p>She&nbsp;ruled there was no legal justification for continuing to conceal the names of more than 150 "John and Jane Does" mentioned in&nbsp;the&nbsp;court&nbsp;filings relating to Epstein.</p><p>Media sued to have the documents made public and they have been released on a rolling basis since 2019.</p><p>Wednesday's unsealing was the eighth release from the 2015 defamation case.</p><p>Giuffre sued Prince Andrew in 2021 for battery and infliction of emotional distress.</p><p><a href=#>They settled in February 2022</a>&nbsp;for a reported £10million, though he has always denied the allegations against him and claimed he could not recall ever meeting Giuffre.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Epstein killed himself in 2019&nbsp;while awaiting trial.</p><p>Maxwell, 62,&nbsp;is serving 20 years for&nbsp;<a href=#>sex trafficking</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/727-jet-playing-cards-cigar-552447535.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000514732958-1.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5e74603f-ede8-48aa-8b75-9b4a816eaa39.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zZ6urGdhZX1xfo9vcGiemafAtXnNmqSeq12fsqey0Z6wZp2gqMGmtc1mqZ6klZbAprCMraadmalir7C5wayfnqScYrCwwdGtZKmZoJq%2FtHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richard-mckinney-footballer-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard McKinney (footballer)s biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr;
