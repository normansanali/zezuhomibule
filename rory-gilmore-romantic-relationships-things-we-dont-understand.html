The entire Gilmore Girl series is a real masterpiece and that's largely due to how amazing Lorelai and Rory were both written and played. That being said, the more we rewatch this show, the harder it becomes to ignore all of the issues surrounding Rory and her many relationships. While Lorelai&nbsp;has her fair share of confusing romantic moments as well, like ignoring her feelings for Luke for over a decade, Rory has still got her beat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, we will be looking back at all of Rory's relationships over the years and revealing the most confusing aspects about them. It really doesn't matter if we're team Jess, Dean or Logan, because in the end, none of their time with Rory made all that much sense.</p><h2 id=her-kiss-and-run-with-jess-was-mean-to-everyone-involved><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Her Kiss-And-Run With Jess Was Mean To Everyone Involved</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1-Rory-Jess-Edited.jpg><p>Let's head back to Sookie's wedding day for a moment. Putting Lorelai's issues that episode aside, we saw Rory plant a kiss on Jess (while she was still dating Dean, of course), tell him immediately not to say anything, then bolted and disappeared for the whole summer without a word. What did this accomplish other than hurt absolutely everyone?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dead-and-rory-s-i-love-you-breakup-didn-t-make-sense-and-went-on-for-way-too-long><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Dead And Rory's 'I Love You' Breakup Didn't Make Sense And Went On For Way Too Long</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2-Dean-and-Rory-Edited.jpg><p>This was an insanely frustrating storyline to get through. All it would have taken was a quick 2 minute convo to clear things up and everything would have been fine. It's not confusing that Rory wanted to wait before saying it back, but the breakup was dramatic and sent the whole town after Dean. All of that and then Rory just decided to say it. UGH!</p><h2 id=logan-shouldn-t-have-been-blamed-for-sleeping-with-honor-s-friends-while-he-and-rory-were-on-a-break><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Logan Shouldn't Have Been Blamed&nbsp;For Sleeping With Honor's Friends&nbsp;While He And Rory Were On A Break</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-Rory-Logan-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Rory had only been mad about how Honor's friends had treated her that day,&nbsp;we would have totally understood. They were the worst. However, to get mad enough at Logan to end things because he had been with a few of them during their break, wasn't right. Logan truly thought they were broken up. Who does she think she is, Rachel Green?</p><h2 id=rory-s-quick-to-accuse-logan-of-cheating-but-she-clearly-doesn-t-have-a-problem-being-the-other-woman><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Rory's Quick To Accuse&nbsp;Logan Of Cheating, But She Clearly Doesn't Have A Problem Being The Other Woman</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4-Logan-Rory-Edited-1.jpg><p>This is one of Rory's more confusing traits. She&nbsp;stayed mad for a long time about Logan hooking up with those girls during their break, but she's also proven time and time again that she doesn't really care about monogamy. She was fine being Dean's other woman and then was fine being Logan's during the revival! Not cool!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-loved-jess-from-the-moment-they-met-so-why-stay-with-dean-for-so-long><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Loved Jess From The Moment They Met, So Why Stay With Dean For So Long?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/5-Jess-and-Rory-Edited.jpg><p>It was obvious that Jess and Rory were feeling each other pretty much the second he arrived in Stars Hollow. She would pretend she hated him, but constantly find ways to spend time with him. If she really didn't care for him, why go on that basket lunch? But she refused to break things off with Dean, even when she saw what it was doing to him.</p><h2 id=even-after-choosing-jess-rory-still-kept-dean-around><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Even After Choosing Jess, Rory&nbsp;Still&nbsp;Kept Dean Around!</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-Dean-Jess-Rory-Edited.jpg><p>For a smart girl, Rory really makes poor life choices. After the miserable public breakup that went down at the dance marathon, Rory was finally free to be happy with Jess and they were happy...for like a minute. However, Rory's need to keep Dean around as a friend was obviously going to ruin this. The winter carnival was so hard to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-she-think-going-to-hang-at-dean-s-parent-s-house-would-be-a-fun-date-after-she-ruined-his-marriage><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Why Did She Think Going To Hang At Dean's Parent's House Would Be A Fun Date After She Ruined His Marriage?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/7-Dean-and-Rory-Edited.jpg><p>The way Rory and Dean just assumed they could kick their romance off from where they had left&nbsp;it as teenagers was so weird. Dean was married and the way his wife found out about Rory was brutal. It's common sense that his parents wouldn't be huge fans of Rory's anymore, though it&nbsp;didn't seem to occurred to either of them.</p><h2 id=not-that-he-cared-but-rory-totally-used-robert><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Not That He Cared, But Rory Totally Used Robert</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/8-Robert-Gilmore-Girls-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rory is really painted out to be sweet and innocent with an excellent head on her shoulders, but the girl does have a conniving side. After Logan told her he didn't want a relationship, she showed up to a party with one of his best friends, obviously knowing it would be enough to get him to commit. Unfortunately for Robert, it totally worked.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Of The Worst Things That Ever Happened On 'Gilmore Girls'</a></span></p><h2 id=she-really-didn-t-understand-why-her-mom-was-mad-when-she-caught-her-with-dean-who-was-married><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Really Didn't Understand Why Her Mom Was Mad When She Caught Her With Dean (Who Was Married)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/9-Lorelai-Gilmore-Edited.png><p>It was never fun to watch these two fight. While Lorelai&nbsp;can be blamed for some of their tiffs, she was very much in the right during this specific one. Rory lost her v-card to Dean (while he was married) and got busted by her mom. When Lorelai rightfully expressed her disappointment, Rory snapped and accused her of ruining her special night!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rory-s-romances-eventually-eclipsed-everything-she-had-been-about-at-the-beginning><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rory's Romances Eventually Eclipsed Everything She Had Been About At The Beginning</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-Rory-Gilmore.jpg><p>Originally, Rory's entire character revolved around her being a bright&nbsp;kid&nbsp;with the potential to do anything she wanted. However, as the show progressed, Rory seemed to push all of her goals and dreams aside to deal with her never-ending relationship dramas. Jess finally calling her out on this&nbsp;was one of the best scenes of&nbsp;the&nbsp;season.</p><h2 id=leading-jess-on-in-philly-was-so-wrong><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Leading Jess On In Philly Was So Wrong</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/11-Rory-Jess-Edited.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As happy as we were to get the chance to catch up with Jess and see that he was doing great in Philadelphia, the reunion was marred by Rory leading him to believe he might finally have a chance at winning her back. She wanted sympathy for what Logan had supposedly done to her, but&nbsp;that wasn't Jess' problem.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Things The Cast Of Gilmore Girls Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=marty-deserved-better><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Marty Deserved Better</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-Marty-Rory-Edited.jpg><p>Now, we are not blaming Rory for not returning Marty's feelings.

If she had made&nbsp;one about her relationship options, it would have definitely come out in Jess' favor, especially in the later seasons. She and Jess always had the most in common, the best chemistry and let's get real, Milo Ventimiglia is gorgeous. However, Rory dated both Logan and Dean for way longer than Jess.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Even The Biggest Fans Don't Know About Gilmore Girls</a></span></p><h2 id=the-emily-rory-jess-dinner-was-as-cringy-as-things-get><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Emily-Rory-Jess Dinner Was As Cringy As Things Get</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/14-Rory-Gilmore-Edited.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was a tough episode to get through.
