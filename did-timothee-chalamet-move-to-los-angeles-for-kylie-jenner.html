He has starred in both critical and commercially successful movies, which makes him sought-after. It’s just speculation that Chalamet bought the house because he knew his relationship with Kylie Jenner would become serious.</p><p>However, Chalamet has been hanging out in L.A. more often after his relationship with Jenner was made public.</p><h2 id=timoth-eacute-e-chalamet-rsquo-s-11-million-house-reflects-his-boosted-net-worth>Timothée Chalamet’s $11 Million House Reflects His Boosted Net Worth</h2><h3 id=chalamet-bought-an-11-million-house-with-a-net-of-25-million>Chalamet bought an $11 million house with a net of $25 million</h3><p>Timothée Chalamet splurging on a house in L.A. signifies that the actor’s net worth is on the rise.

That's living in a good place.</p><p>Surrounded by neighbors like Eva Longoria, Vin Dinsel, Cameron Diaz, and John Meyer, the luxurious house is definitely a step up for the Call Me By Your Name actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And judging by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Timothée Chalamet's net worth of $25 million</a>, the actor put in a lot for the house.
