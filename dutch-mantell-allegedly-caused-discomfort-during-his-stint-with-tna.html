In the recent episode of <a href=#>My World With Jeff Jarrett</a>, the WWE Hall of Famer delves into TNA’s status in 2004, Dutch Mantell’s divisive impact, and other noteworthy topics. You can check out what he has to say below.</p><p>Jarrett begins his podcast by talking about Dutch Mantell rubbing people the wrong way in TNA. He said people being rubbed the wrong way by Mantell has happened “many, many [times].” He further added that Mantell does not care about his impact on others or what they think of him by asserting that “do you think he cares at times? Hell no.”</p><p>The specific instance of Dutch not being a <a href=#>fan of Jerry Lynn was also brought up</a>, with Jeff Jarrett expressing skepticism about the credibility of such claims. He believed that it just “isn’t true” and that it makes zero sense. He further provided an explanation on how the truth could have been manipulated.</p><p>The conversation shifted to the dynamics within TNA in 2004, shedding light on the challenges faced by the promotion. It was suggested that roster limitations, with only funding for 20 out of 30 talents, led to the need for turnover talent. Dutch Mantell, known for his straightforward approach, reportedly played a role in conveying the reality to the wrestlers. This included giving some talents a heads up that they might not be booked for certain events.</p><p>Jarrett further discussed the potential impact of unmet expectations on wrestlers, such as thinking they would be booked and then not receiving pay. He also highlighted the importance of honesty and transparency in managing talent expectations to avoid resentment and discord.</p><p>“Dutch rubbing people the wrong way? Oh, many, many [times]. I mean, Dutch can rub folks the wrong way. But do you think he cares at times? Hell no. But him not being a fan of Jerry Lynn? Just drilling that down makes zero sense. It just doesn’t ring true. Now, here’s how that can kind of be manipulated. ‘Hey, you know what? We’ve got 30 guys on the roster, and Panda is only going to pay for 20. We need to have turnover talent, we probably ought to give some talent a heads up that they’re getting a rest.’ Because that’s the worst thing, is to bring guys with the expectation, ‘You’re going to get booked,’ or ‘You’re going to come and you’re going to work,’ or whatever it may be and then nothing happens. And then that kind of creates the discourse and the resentment, and all that. Because you think you’re getting paid, then you’re not getting paid and all that. I’m sure that was the case with Jerry and many others. And Dutch would be one of the ones to say, ‘Hey, we’re gonna be honest. You’re not gonna like what I say right now. But not everybody’s gonna get a slot every Wednesday night. There’s gonna be some folks that just aren’t gonna get booked.’ And then you have that ‘Dutch doesn’t like Jerry,’ which is total BS.”</p><p>In conclusion, the revelations from the My World With Jeff Jarrett episode provide insights into the candid and sometimes challenging dynamics within TNA, with Dutch Mantell playing a role in delivering straightforward messages to the talent about the limitations and challenges faced by the promotion.
