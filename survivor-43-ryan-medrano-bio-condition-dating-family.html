The Survivor 43 cast included a clinical psychologist, a teacher, a Paralympian, and a cerebral palsy patient. Among the 18 competitors appearing on Survivor Season 43, Ryan Medrano was one.</p><p>Read this&nbsp; article till the very end to learn about Ryan’s Survivor 43 stint, his condition, job, dating life, and more.</p><h3><strong>Ryan Medrano On Survivor 43</strong></h3><p>Hosted by Jeff Probst, Survivor 43 kicked off with a two-hour premiere on September 21st on the CBS network. This season, 18 players are fighting to win the title of Sole Survivor and a grand cash prize of $1 million.</p><p>According to ew.com, Ryan’s favorite hobbies are fishing, hiking, and carpentry and his pet peeves are bullies, laziness, and self-entitlement.</p><p>Since his birth, Ryan Medrano had to find his own way to solve things. Born with cerebral palsy, doctors said he wouldn’t be able to walk. Despite the odds against him, Ryan learned to walk and converse with people after four years of therapy.</p><p>Ryan always had to read body language and facial expressions to anticipate the next moves. He believes this skill will help him read people well and tell when they’re lying in Survivor.</p><p>In an interview with Parade.com, Ryan revealed why he was on Survivor. His response was: ‘I’m here on Survivor because when I see Survivor on TV… I’m like, “That looks amazing. These people are going through <a href=#>life</a>-changing events and really finding more out about themselves.”</p><p>Ryan also shared that he usually identifies the most with the non-winners. He said Rupert or Xander are the non-winners he identifies a lot with. One of the winners that Ryan likes is Parvati. He was particularly impressed by the way she played the game.</p><p>When asked about what type of player was he looking for in an alliance, he said he wants two people whom he can trust and understand their body language so that if they ever come to a point at the end, he may be able to get them to tell him the truth, “Hey, we’re thinking about voting you out. Give me a reason why we shouldn’t.” And he also wants those two people to find two people.</p><h3><strong>Ryan Medrano Condition</strong></h3><p>As we told earlier, Ryan Medrano was born three months early and had a condition called cerebral palsy at the time of birth. Although the doctor said Ryan could not walk his whole life, after going through therapy for four years, he was able to walk and converse with people like a normal human.</p><p>However, it made his thinking a little slow.
