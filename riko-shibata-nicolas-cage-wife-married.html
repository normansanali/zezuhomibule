Her husband's rep confirmed the news</span><span>&nbsp;on Thursday to People as they said, <strong>"The parents-to-be are elated! Nicolas and Riko tied the knot in a very small and intimate wedding at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas."</strong></span></p><p><span>Riko Shibata is expecting her first baby with Nicolas Cage as his fifth wife. Her husband was married to Erika Koike in Las Vegas, which lasted for only four days as they requested annulment on their fourth day.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Inside Her Married Life With Nicolas Cage</span></strong></h2><p><span>Rika Shibata and Nicolas Cage first met each other through mutual friends in 2020 in Shiga, Japan. Her husband, Cage, was in Japan to film the movie, Prisoners of the Ghostland. They first made their public appearance as a couple on their magazine cover for FLAUNT in October 2021.</span></p><p><span>They also made their red carpet debut together as a couple in 2021 at the premiere of Cage's film Pig and had attended the red carpet at the 2021 GQ Men of the Year party in West Hollywood, California.</span></p><p><span>The actor Nicolas announced their engagement on his brother's radio show and said:</span></p><p><span><strong>"She left New York and went back to Kyoto, Japan and I went back to Nevada and I haven't seen her for six months. We're really happy together and we're really excited to spend that time together so I finally just said, 'Look. I wanna marry you and we got engaged on FaceTime."</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple was first spotted together when they visited his famous tomb in February 2020, which he bought for himself decades earlier.&nbsp;</span><span>Riko married Nicolas Cage in a poetic Japanese wedding ceremony.</span></p><p><span>Riko dressed in a handmade Japanese Bridal Kimono from Kyoto during their wedding ceremony, and Nicolas was in a Tom Ford tuxedo. They exchanged their traditional Catholic and Shinto vows with poetry, as per the reports from People. Famous poets like Walt Whitman and Haiku poems were included in their wedding, and after the ceremony, they headed to a small gathering at the home of Nicolas' ex-wife, Alice Kim.</span></p><p><span>According to Cage's representative, their wedding date was chosen to celebrate the bridegroom's late father's birthday. They applied for their wedding license on January 10â€” the day she turned 26.</span></p><p><span>Riko also walked down the aisle to her favorite song called Winter Song by Kiroro.</span></p><p><span>Before Riko, her famous actor husband, Nicolas, married four times. Nicolas was married to Alice Kim from 2004 to 2016 and shared their youngest son, Kal-El, and he was married to Patricia Arquette from 1995 to 2001.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nicolas was also married to Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley, and it took two years to divorce each other. Nicolas had tied the knot with Erika Koike for just a few days in 2019. He had his oldest son, Weston, with Christina Fulton, although they were never married.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, as his present fifth wife, Riko has taken his last name and is legally Riko Cage.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who Is Riko Shibata?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Riko Shibata is an actress from Japan, and her current age is 27 years old. She married the famous Hollywood star Nicolas Cage who is 30 years older than her, and she is just four years younger than his oldest son, Weston Coppola Cage.</span></p><p><span>As revealed by her husband, Nicolas, her favorite color is black, who further stated that he got her a black diamond engagement ring.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46roKSnXai1qq7ArZhmppmYvK2t0maamp%2BVYsSqssRmpJqqop6ypQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-does-cam-newton-use-that-font.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Does Cam Newton Use That Font?
