However, there are many appeals as to whether Margot (Melissa George), Allie’s wife, will permit him to jeopardize the safety of the family or not.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is The Mosquito Coast Renewed After Season 2?</h2><p>The Mosquito Coast has been cancelled by Apple TV+ after two seasons.
