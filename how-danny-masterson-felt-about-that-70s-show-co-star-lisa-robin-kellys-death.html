Among them was a DUI in 2010 in North Carolina, resulting in a 12-month probation sentence. Things would only spiral even further as in March of 2012, the actress was involved in suspicion of spousal abuse with ex-boyfriend John Michas. As if the arrest news wasn't embarrassing enough, Lisa Robin Kelly had to face her mugshot getting exposed to the world, and that included her own mother.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Debra Jo Rupp Really Felt About Working With Her Late That '70s Show Co-Star, Lisa Robin Kelly</a></span></p><p>Just prior to her passing, Kelly was taking aim at improving herself, entering a rehab program.

I spoke to her on Monday and she was hopeful and confident, looking forward to putting this part of her life behind her. (Wednesday) night she lost the battle. Cause of death has not been issued yet and no death certificate has been issued either,” her agent Craig Wyckoff said at the time.</p><p>Lisa Robin Kelly was a valued member of the That '70s Show family, and that was especially true for Danny Masterson.</p><h2 id=danny-masterson-had-praise-for-lisa-robin-kelly-and-offered-his-condolences>Danny Masterson Had Praise For Lisa Robin Kelly And Offered His Condolences</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/your-paragraph-text-2023-09-14t114901-009.png><p>At the time of her passing, Danny Masterson took to Twitter,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">offering his condolences</a>.

The late Lisa Robin Kelly was later replaced by actress Christina Moore as of season six, which was a very unpopular decision among That '70s Show fans.</p><h2 id=danny-masterson-was-closest-to-ashton-kutcher-among-the-that-39-70s-show-cast>Danny Masterson Was Closest To Ashton Kutcher Among The That '70s Show Cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar46161381.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danny Masterson had several close connections on That '70s Show. However, his closest friendship was to Ashton Kutcher. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two spoke about their closeness several times in the past</a>, and that included the duo's nights out together.</p><p>"Nobody was gonna take your picture, so you could really wild out, and nobody would know what you did last night," Kutcher said.</p><p>"I have more photos of commando Kutcher here naked in a club than probably anybody, with my Polaroid," Masterson replied.</p><p>Kutcher and Masterson would reunite for The Ranch, and it seemed like the duo had just picked up where they left off with That '70s Show.</p><p>In the recent times, Kutcher tried to back his friend up with a letter in court, and that ended up doing more harm than good following Masterson's guilty verdict and 30-year sentence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Danny's relationship with other cast members, it appears as though everyone is keeping quiet. Nonetheless, fans are still praising Topher Grace for apparently keeping his distance from the cast during the show's run. However, Grace revealed he was still close to the cast members, he just had other priorities at the time.</p><p>"I was so messed up the first couple of years that a lot of the cast was more fun and would go out more," he said. "And I didn't even date anyone the first couple of years. I was so trying to do a good job on the show. Sometimes people will say, 'Were you not as close to them?' and it really makes me sad because they're all still great."</p><p>Without a doubt, there will be fewer mentions of Masterson moving forward by those involved on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dma6vuthmpJqrpJq%2FtLvNZp2epKRirqO71K1kraCRqXp4fNJmqqGnp2KwsHnSrZirZZyewKJ50aiZoqZdoLKtuNisZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-was-brett-favre-when-he-retired.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Old Was Brett Favre When He Retired and Where is He Now?">&larr;
