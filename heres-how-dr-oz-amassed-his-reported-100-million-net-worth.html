Actually, he's famous worldwide. Oprah dubbed him "America's Doctor"!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his rise to talk show fame, the good doctor has had his hands in a lot of different pots. He's a doctor, a chairman, an author, and a talk show host, but it seems Dr. Oz is just getting started.</p><p>Over the course of his career, he's reportedly made over $100 million! Some of his money-making tactics have been a little bit controversial. You can't make this much money without causing a stir!</p><p>Here, we will discuss some of his most lucrative streams of income.</p><h2 id=he-married-the-daughter-of-a-surgeon><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Married The Daughter Of A Surgeon</span></h2><p>Coincidentally, or not so coincidentally, in 1985, Dr. Oz fell in love with (and eventually married) Lisa Lemole, who is the daughter of a successful cardiothoracic surgeon.</p><p>Now, we're assuming this union inspired Dr. Oz to pursue his career with even greater fervor... it also definitely got his career off on the right foot. Connections are important when it comes to making money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-became-a-cardiothoracic-surgeon><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He Became&nbsp;A Cardiothoracic Surgeon</span></h2><p>Dr. Oz started his career journey&nbsp;by studying at Harvard and then pursued a medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He focused on cardiothoracic surgery, which, for us ordinary folk, is a fancy way of saying that he specializes in heart and lung surgery.</p><p>Even now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he performs an</a> estimated 200 surgeries annually. It's also worth noting that he received a business degree, which could explain his incredible ability to market himself.</p><h2 id=he-was-a-recurring-guest-on-the-oprah-winfrey-show><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He Was A Recurring Guest On The Oprah Winfrey Show</span></h2><p>This is the program which launched Dr. Oz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">into the stratosphere</a>. When he first appeared&nbsp;on Oprah's show in 2001, he would take time to answer questions and give personalized advice to audience members. Soon, he became one of Oprah's favorite guests, and he appeared on her show 55 times over the span of 5 years. He still makes guest appearances every now and then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-is-a-professor-at-columbia-university><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>He Is A Professor At Columbia University</span></h2><p>Throughout all of the controversies he has&nbsp;faced, Dr. Oz has been able to hold on to his tenured position at Columbia University, where he teaches surgery. On top of that, he is also the director of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Integrative Medicine Center at Columbia Surgery</a>. We're not sure how often he's teaching students, but we are sure his classes must be booked solid.</p><h2 id=he-was-the-medical-director-for-john-q><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Was The Medical Director For John Q</span></h2><p>Yes, the 2002 film! Apparently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during the shoot</a>, Dr. Oz performed some of the filmed procedures himself, and also directed the cast and crew on the correct way to perform certain surgeries.</p><p>Though he wasn't making the millions that the movie's leading man, Denzel Washington, was surely earning, Dr. Oz was definitely starting to make some noise in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=he-launched-the-dr-oz-show><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Launched The Dr. Oz Show</span></h2><p>The Dr. Oz Show, currently in syndication all around the United States, launched in 2009, via Oprah's production company, Harpo Productions. It's been on the air for over 10 years and it was just renewed for yet another season. It's estimated that his program <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brings in over 3.5 million viewers per day</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-does-live-events><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Does Live Events</span></h2><p>If you can't get enough of Dr. Oz on TV, be sure to catch him on tour. In the past, he's conducted live events and workshops around the country. For instance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2007, he held a workshop</a> called, "It's All About You: Be The World Expert On Your Body". The workshop brought multitudes of his loyal fans out into the open.</p><h2 id=he-is-a-new-york-times-bestselling-author><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Is A New York Times Bestselling Author</span></h2><p>His "You" series of books are successful. 9 million copies have been printed. There are many hit titles, including You: The Owner's Manual, You: The Smart Patient and You: On A Diet.</p><p>We can only guess as to how much Dr. Oz raked in after publishing his bestselling series. We DO know that Dr. Oz got $7 million as an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">advance</a>, just to write the books! The publishers must have had a lot of faith that the books would do well.</p><h2 id=he-s-the-co-founder-of-sharecare-inc><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He's The Co-Founder Of Sharecare, Inc.</span></h2><p>This online healthcare platform is marketed as a tool to help people get answers to their most-asked health questions, by putting&nbsp;a variety of health experts right at their fingertips.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Oz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said of his company</a>, "[w]ith Sharecare, we have created a resource that invites everyone from experts to new moms to share valuable insights about our mind, body and soul and with this information comes a combined IQ on health that is greater than the sum of its parts."</p><p>Co-founder Jeff Arnold <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">divulged in 2016</a> that the company makes over $259 million in revenue yearly. That's a lot of health advice!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celebs Oprah Winfrey Is Surprisingly Close To</a></span></p><h2 id=he-had-a-sirius-xm-radio-talk-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Had A Sirius XM Radio Talk Show</span></h2><p>If you didn't want to watch Dr. Oz on television, it was possible to catch him doling out medical advice via his radio show, The Daily Dose with Dr. Oz. Unfortunately, it seems that the radio show had a dip in ratings,&nbsp;probably because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his past controversies</a>,</p><p>Oprah's production company eventually decided to quietly cancel the show. But, while it was airing, we're sure Dr. Oz saw a nice bump in ad revenue!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Things We Just Learned About Howard Stern's Radio Show</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-a-contributing-writer><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He's A Contributing Writer</span></h2><p>Is Dr. Oz the Energizer Bunny in disguise? Along with everything else he's doing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's written for publications</a> like Esquire Magazine, Time Magazine, AARP Magazine and Oprah's O Magazine. These aren't just freelance writing gigs, either. There have been columns specifically reserved for the doctor.</p><p>His advice is found in nationally renowned publications and probably brings him a pretty penny.</p><h2 id=he-holds-a-patent-for-a-medical-device><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Holds A Patent For A Medical Device</span></h2><p>He's also an inventor, just in case you thought he was only a doctor, writer, media consultant, teacher, board member, etc. His brainchild, the Mitraclip,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is a small device</a> that can be used to hold mitral valve "flaps" together, to avert heart failure.</p><p>The best news is it can be attached to the heart without risky open-heart surgery. If only all heart problems could be solved with small, non-invasive surgeries!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-currently-on-the-president-s-council-on-sports-fitness-and-nutrition><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He's Currently On The President's Council On Sports, Fitness And Nutrition</span></h2><p>He's a member of the council, which is made up of professional athletes, doctors, and other leaders in the sports and nutrition world. The whole object of the exercise is to get more young people to, well, exercise. The council is also here to "promote healthy and active lifestyles for all Americans,"&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the council website</a>. Dr. Oz was appointed in 2018.</p><h2 id=he-owns-a-lot-of-real-estate><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Owns A Lot Of Real Estate</span></h2><p>The media mogul doctor dropped about $18 million to purchase <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Palm Beach property called Louwana</a>. Apparently, the historic house&nbsp;has been through some tough times, and this made it possible for Dr. Oz to scoop it up at a "discount" rate. It was on the market previously for over $30 million.</p><p>He also owns a sprawling 9,153 square foot villa, with four parcels of land, in Cliffside Park, New Jersey.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">19 Surprising Facts About Dr. Phil's $30 Million Mansion</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-an-investor><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He's An Investor</span></h2><p>Dr. Oz has made a name for himself by trying to peddle the latest and greatest health wonders&nbsp;to his adoring fans, so it makes perfect sense that he invests in health discoveries before they become the big new things.</p><p>One such investment was with a health tech startup called iBeat&nbsp;in 2016. The wearable monitor was designed to help recognize and prevent sudden cardiac death. Dr. Oz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly invested</a> a "6-figure amount to the company."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Facts That Reveal Who The REAL Dr. Oz Is</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9Zmm6tln696ornArKqenF2dtrR50Z6nqKqkmrFufY9pZKahnKG2sLqMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./labneh-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Homemade Labneh">&larr;
