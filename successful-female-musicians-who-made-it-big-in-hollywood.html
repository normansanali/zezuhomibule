Not only are they subject to discrimination, targeted harassment, and unequal pay, but they also have to navigate the trials and tribulations of being overly sexualized and being brushed over by labels. It always seems like female musicians need to work ten times as hard to establish themselves, so it is only more admirable when these musicians continue to break more glass ceilings by succeeding in Hollywood as well!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Usually, talented people who are fired by passion have endless ambitions, and these performers did not hesitate to pursue their passion for acting and filmmaking. Movies take fans on journeys just as music does, so it feels natural to see these female musicians seamlessly transition into the world of acting. Some of them made it big earning accolades and critical acclaim, others are still figuring their way to conquering both the world of music and the world of film and television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These 8 Movie Stars Were Discovered Completely By Chance">These 8 Movie Stars Were Discovered Completely By Chance</a></span></p><h2 id=awkwafina-had-her-acting-debut-on-crazy-rich-asians><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Awkwafina Had Her Acting Debut On Crazy Rich Asians</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in New York, Nora Lum A.K.A Awkwafina gained initial fame for being a rapper and comedian.

She also had minor roles in The Giver, The Lorax, and most recently in Amsterdam alongside Margot Robbie and Christian Bale. <a href=#>Taylor Swift's acting career however is bigger than many fans think</a>, with the singer expressing that she's taking up directing seriously as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has acted in and directed her own music videos before</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Taylor Swift Says She's Done Taking Baby Steps As A Director">Taylor Swift Says She's Done Taking Baby Steps As A Director</a></span></p><h2 id=barbra-streisand-is-a-hallmark-in-the-world-of-music-and-film><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Barbra Streisand Is A Hallmark In The World Of Music And Film</span></h2><p>Those who aren't aware of Barbra Streisand's immense talent in acting and singing must be living under a rock. With an impressive 36 studio albums and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with more than 90 million records worldwide, Streisand is one of the best-selling artists of all time</a>.

She was very open about her being bullied at school with her classmates trashing her ambitions to become an actress. Needless to say, she proved her bullies wrong. Gaga was already a hallmark in the world of pop music with albums like Born This Way topping charts worldwide. But her breakout role in the critically acclaimed film A Star Is Born made her an absolute name to be reckoned with in Hollywood as she proved to be more than capable as an actress. She was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, and won The Best Original Song Oscar for her song Shallow that was featured in the film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrpuTmsC0stSlZJ%2BdnZa5pnnMrqqim5mWu7R51qGmZqWRmbJutdNmmaKfXZ67brTOpaOyr5%2BksXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amd-launches-highfrequency-epyc-7371-processor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AMD Launches High-Frequency EPYC 7371 Processor">&larr;
