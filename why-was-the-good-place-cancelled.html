Some shows, like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office</a>, become classics, while others can be canned by the network shortly after airing their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pilot episode</a>. It’s tough, but the shows that find a large audience are rewarded handsomely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Good Place</a> was a fantastic series during its run on television, finding legions of fans and earning acclaim in no time. While the show certainly could have kept going, it came to an end sooner than most were expecting, leading many fans to wonder why the creators and the network chose to pull the plug so early.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at&nbsp;The Good Place and learn why the series was ended&nbsp;after just four seasons on NBC.</p><h2 id=the-good-place-was-an-immediate-success>‘The Good Place’ Was An Immediate Success</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05B09D97-4FE3-4469-91C4-34139E663B16.jpeg><p>Debuting back in September of 2016,&nbsp;The Good Place proved to be a welcomed addition the the lineup being offered by NBC, and the series brought in a large audience in no time. This was thanks to not only having excellent previews, but also having massive talent, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michael Schur, the series creator, has a remarkable track record on the small screen, with few creators in history coming close to matching what he has done during his time in Hollywood. Schur was a writer and producer on&nbsp;The Office,&nbsp;he co-created&nbsp;Parks and Recreation,&nbsp;and he even co-created&nbsp;Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Yeah, the man is a writing genius, and he brought his ‘A’ game to&nbsp;The Good Place back in 2016.</p><p>With Schur being the creative mind behind the show, he needed the right cast to bring it to life, and the casting of performers like Kristen Bell and Ted Danson proved to be a stroke of genius for the show. Jameela Jamil and William Jackson Harper were excellent additions, as well.</p><p>The immediate success of&nbsp;The Good Place certainly caught the buzz of mainstream audiences, who helped spread excellent word-of-mouth for the show. This, in turn, helped the show thrive in what can usually be an unforgiving medium. As such, there was hope that the series would be around for the long haul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Good Place: Best Season 1 Episodes, According To IMDb</a></span></p><h2 id=it-could-have-kept-going>It Could Have Kept Going</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/9E170987-0569-4CBA-B3B3-E8E3D43ADD96.jpeg><p>Normally, a successful show will look to keep the ball rolling, as there is a considerable amount of money that can be made when something really takes off with fans. It certainly seemed like&nbsp;The Good Place was going to be a show that could remain fresh and relevant while moving along, but things weren’t meant to last for long.</p><p>For four seasons, the show continued to deliver big on the small screen, and it managed to take home some truly impressive awards along the way. It was even nominated for a number of Primetime Emmy Awards, though it was unable to secure a win at the coveted event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were hopeful for a fifth season of the show, but Michael Schur was adamant that a fourth season was going to be its last.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Schur</a>, “At times over the past few years we've been tempted to go beyond four seasons, but mostly because making the show is a rare, creatively fulfilling joy, and at the end of the day, we don't want to tread water just because the water is so warm and pleasant.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Kristen Bell Has Been Up To Since 'The Good Place' Ended</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ending-was-planned-early-on>The Ending Was Planned Early On</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CD5BD1CB-2849-48A5-9D8A-4D301A368A63.jpeg><p>So, why just four seasons? Turns out, this was in the cards for quite some time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Creator Michael Schur&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about this</a>, saying, “After The Good Place was picked up for season two, the writing staff and I began to map out, as best as we could, the trajectory of the show. Given the ideas we wanted to explore, and the pace at which we wanted to present those ideas, I began to feel like four seasons—just over 50 episodes—was the right lifespan.”</p><p>Fans were caught off guard by the announcement, as most shows will overstay their welcome in the name of reaching the coveted 100-episode mark for mass syndication. Nevertheless, the entire fandom tuned in to each episode of the final season, giving the series a proper sendoff. Unlike many of the shows that came before it,&nbsp;The Good Place managed to stick its landing, which the fans appreciated.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What The Cast Of 'The Good Place' Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>The Good Place had an incredible run on the small screen, and while it was short, the team behind the show made the most of their moment in the sun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What The Cast Of 'The Good Place' Is Up To Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60edOhnGafn6SxbrzLmpqeZZOWu6Sxy6WcnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zayn-malik-coparenting-gigi-hadid-yolanda-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zayn Malik Speaks Out on Co-Parenting With Ex Gigi Hadid">&larr;
