Looks like, he got what he wanted with the cast of up-and-coming young Korean actors doing justice to their roles.</p><p style=text-align:left>Now, meet Lee Eun-Saem, who along with her co-stars Ha Seung-Ri (as Jang Ha-ri), Kim Bo-Yoon (as Seo Hyo-Ryung), Ahn Seung-Kyoon (as Oh Joon-Young), <a href=#>Jin Ho-Eun</a> (as Jang Min-Jae), Ahn Ji-Ho (as Kim Cheol-Soo), <a href=#>Shin Jae-Hwi</a> (as Chang-Hoon) and Kim Jin-Young (as Kim Ji-Min), rounds out the cast of the series as its supporting cast members.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lee Eun-Saem On All of Us Are Dead</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>So, actress Lee Eun-Saem appears as Park Mi-Jin in the 2022 South Korean zombie-apocalypse series that is being hailed as the new Squid Game, or as critics put it, as something that is paced like a bullet and emotionally resonant when it needs to be.</p><p>With 12 episodes running at least an hour each, All of Us Are Dead splits its story between the nightmare unfolding at the school and the one consuming the world beyond. Among all these, Lee’s character is a <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>blunt nicotine addict and one of the bullies </span>stuck in the cafeteria.</p><p>Lee has been drawing attention also because her playing a bad student who smokes and swears in school, in Netflix’s original Korean series is very different from her previous popular character of court lady Son Young-hee in The Red Sleeve. So, this “chameleon-like transformation” has now been the talk of especially her town.</p><p>The Red Sleeve is a South Korean television series starring that aired on MBC, the South Korean network, from November 2021 to January 2022. And Lee played the most thoughtful and affectionate companion. She was a court lady who got pregnant due to fornication then passed away after having a miscarriage. On contrary, in In&nbsp;All of Us Are Dead she looks certainly different, engaged in smoking and swearing. But this no way means that she has not done her justice to the role. To tell you the truth, even amidst such chaos, Lee’s character has captured viewers’ attention with her unmatched will to survive.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lee Eun-Saem Net Worth</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lee Eun-Saem reportedly had almost an estimated $300K net worth as of 31 January 2022.</p><p>She made her acting debut in a supporting role of Seung Nam in the&nbsp;TV Novel: Landscape In My Heart&nbsp;back in 2007. The next year, she was seen in Kokkiri. In 2009, she was taken in a supporting role of Soo Ji in Fly, Penguin.</p><p>Then, Lee took some years off likely to focus on her studies. (She was yet to reveal her educational background as well.)</p><p>Finally, in 2017, her fans got to see her again on their screen. She played Lee So Eun in the South Korean streaming series&nbsp;Sweet Revenge&nbsp;and the same year she got her big part of kidnapped high school girl Eun Sam in&nbsp;Midnight Runners.</p><p>2018 meant a guest role in Priest, the supporting role of Lee Seul-Ki in Bad Papa, other supporting roles of Young Ju in&nbsp;Miracle That We Met, and of Choi Sung Ji in&nbsp;Drama Stage Season 1: Anthology.</p><p>In 2019, The Fault Is Not Yours, The Gangster, The Cop and The Devil, and Innocent Witness, and the rest is history.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Does Lee Eun-Saem Have A Boyfriend?</strong></h3><p>Lee Eun-Saem did not seem to have a boyfriend as of the time of this writing. From the look of her social media, she rather seemed occupied by her getting-bigger career.
